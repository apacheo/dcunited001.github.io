# [From the Soul, Defined, to Jung's Individuation](#from-the-soul-defined-to-jungs-individuation)

At the end of her [third
video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TTrc7zmBh1M&t=0s&index=5&list=PLC4D19CAA84861524)
on I Ching, [Nana Akosua Baakan
Agyeiwaah](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLC4D19CAA84861524),
makes a very simple statement that resonates powerfully, *if you
understand what the soul is*. It doesn't necessarily require the
definition of the soul outlined below, but if you understand what the
soul is, this statement is very powerful:

> The oracle is a vehicle to help us listen to our soul speak, but we
> must be *quiet* if we are to hear what our soul is trying to speak
> to us.

<a name="the-soul-is-not-contained-entirely-within-your-body" />

### [The Soul Is Not Contained Entirely Within Your Body](#the-soul-is-not-contained-entirely-within-your-body)

The first statement: if the soul exists purely within us, why would we
need to listen to it speak? We should already know what the soul is.
There are aspects of our soul which exist outside of us, whether this
is information that exists substantiated in material form or
connections to elements within the *astral plane* or shards of our
soul that exist in some purely incorporeal plane.

From my own shortcomings in communication, what I've learned is to
listen to others. By listening to Nana Akosua, I've learned a lot and
I can tell that she has the same *a postieri* familiarity with
philosophical and spiritual concepts that I do; it is simply developed
with more wisdom, practice and contact with people. I apologize if
saying this implies that she has shortcomings in communication: she
doesn't. I've learned a lot from watching her videos. However, my own
weaknesses there have taught me to examine the experience and word of
others for substance, *not appearance of substance*. True substance
lies within. Extrapolations

<a name="if-the-soul-is-not-purely-internal-then-how-does-one-know-their-own-soul" />

### [Then How Does One Know Their Own Soul?](#then-how-does-one-know-their-own-soul)

The second statement: we must be still to separate ourselves from the
noise of life that interferes with the vibrations from our soul. We
need to develop that sense of a soul connection, so that our actions
*resonate* with our deeper, more authentic self -- it is found
*somewhere* in our soul, but that might not exist within us already.

<a name="one-does-not-simply-accept-their-identity" />

### [One Does Not Simply Accept Their Identity](#one-does-not-simply-accept-their-identity)

So many people accept at face value either some identity given to them
by others or perhaps the assumed identity developed by a younger
self. They stop looking or maybe they've never looked much at
all. This is what's so dangerous about the materialist misconception
that *there is no soul!* What do you mean by that? Do you even know?
To the person who needs soul-searching, if they believe the soul
resides entirely within some interalized encoding of matter interally,
then they allow the noise of life to define all they see and all they
think. They believe the extent of their soul to exist entirely
separately of society and this is a dangerous assumption because it
deprives the person of power over their mind, over their life and over
the composition of their soul.

<a name="didnt-i-say-that-her-statement-had-a-powerful-effect-on-me" />

### [Didn't I Say That Her Statement Had A Powerful Effect?](#didnt-i-say-that-her-statement-had-a-powerful-effect)

If you can manage to separate yourself from the mental mazes that
life's trappings has you running in your mind, then you can start to
zero out life's noise to calibrate a clearer picture of your true self
-- who is not *one*, but *many*. Your soul contains within it all your
potential selves: some unrealized; others that have remained out of
focus; more still are as yet unknown to you, without further knowledge
of self! This knowledge of self provides a collection of lenses and
perspectives that form a kind of a microscope for your mind, your soul
and your self. What seems blurry today should seem more clear
tomorrow. And iff you tune this scope of self knowledge, then you'll
see your composite actualized selves coalescing from your self
awareness breaking through threshold shadows of unconscious.

<a name="are-the-myriad-fragments-of-your-soul-searching-for-knowledge-of-self" />

### [Are The Myriad Fragments of Your Soul Searching For Knowledge of Self?](#are-the-myriad-fragments-of-your-soul-searching-for-knowledge-of-self)

The true key is to listen to people: they contain within them
fragments of your soul that you must collect. If you do not listen,
you cannot see clearly. If someone has made it so that you cannot hear
them at all, then you may be lost for some time.  If you're lucky, you
find that most of your newfound selves are also searching for their
knowledge of self: the fragments of your soul or socially distributed
self are themselves searching for self. When you develop a clearer
resolution of self, you begin collecting information from these
socially distributed fragments that key you in to your whole soul,
entirely. This is your true self, but if you are not *still*, you
cannot *listen*. Once you learn to listen, you can begin to learn to
perturb the local social configuration to then filter and percolate
inferences about those scattered fragments of soul.

<a name="the-formation-of-the-interface-between-psychee-and-unconscious" />

### (1) [The Formation of the Interface Between Psyche and Unconscious](#the-formation-of-the-interface-between-psychee-and-unconscious)

Perhaps driven by some miraculous accident in youth, when your psyche
still nascent forming shone a light unto the right unconscious corners
, then perhaps this configured the interface between one's psyche and
the unconscious in some miraculous way. To what end? To Seek
continuous self improvement without the defect of a false sense of
completion after one learns so much of the world. How does one stay on
the path?  How does one stay course on the Hero's journey? Does the
hero with the longest journey result with unsurpassed heroic
development?

### (2) [An Unconscious Metatype In The Reward System's Framework]()

Some miracle compels the early and prevalent formation of a metatype
in your psyche's reward systems that pushes you towards self-awareness
and self-improvement for some higher goal, wherefore the true extent
of which you must remain somewhat unconscious. If you can define the
extent your goals in totality, then they are not great enough to
compel you onwards along the Hero's journey. It must be something
seemingly insurmountable that you will master because you must
overcome it, not because you understand it or are capable of
deconstructing it. This is the true path to awakening and
self-actualization: it is indeed *not* medication, IMO, though that
may help some to numb their pain. Yet, isn't there a purpose to pain?
It's a signal like no other, and it's there for a reason.

### (3) []()

If you were unconscious to what drove you to seek self-improvement by
expanding knowledge of self, then it might more strongly express
itself almost as if by instinct. One does not simply "turn off" that
of which one is unaware. Therefore, mid-development, as you begin to
awaken to the sophisticated metacognition and the self-reflection
required for self-actualization, then that instinctual compulsion has
perhaps given you quite a head start.

### (4)

To catalyze self-actualization requires disaggregating the influences
on your mind that spawned so many selves that were  so the most significant
versions of them can be known and reverse-engineered.

# [Doxastic Games: Telephone, The Rumor Mill, and Your Eternal Torment](#doxastic-games-telephone-the-rumor-mill-and-your-eternal-torment)

Understanding how people understand your identity is critical. We all
operate, given some notion of self, by comparing our sense of self
with that of the identity of others. People play [epistemic
games](https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/epistemic-game/) and
doxastic games[^doxastic-games]: games centered around projection and
propagation of belief. Understanding the idea of doxastic games
requires incredibly deep knowledge of game theory, but these are games

### [Eternal Torment of the Soul is A Doxastic Game](#eternal-torment-of-the-soul-is-a-doxastic-game)

People can torment you, perhaps eternally, by targeting those
fragments of your soul scattered through society. If they are better
at playing doxastic games, they can strongly influence the social
residue of your soul to distort the collective social memories that
relate to your identity. In extreme cases, they can torment your
aeternal soul perhaps for all time. It requires power. Power over such
horrible, *paltry* people requires power itself. When you find you
have none, power is best obtained through knowledge. Knowledge is
power.

The truth about belief in doxastic games? It does not hold a candle to

strategy or tactics. Light walks in the truth, the truth walks in the

and the power of truth as a guardian, then you need to go to
school.

### [Fabrication is the CIA's Specialty](#fabrication-is-the-cias-specialty)

This is why, for any fabrication operation, pulling the wool over
someone's eyes is necessary: they must be constantly lied to, deprived
of information necessary to their job, etc. So that when the
pre-ordained endgame occurs, the disinformation and misinformation
enshrouds the apprehension that the righteous has of the truth. They
reach for the truth as their weapon, but they do not have it. It was
pre-meditated fabrication. The thing about fabrication? There's no
handbook for fabrication. Where there was one fabrication operation,
there are many. The thing about sin is that you must hide it or hide
from it the rest of your life. That's what the story of Jesus was
about, in case you missed it -- freeing man from sin. And if you don't
believe in sinful nature or profiting from the sinful nature of
others, then you don't propagate the methods of doing so to your
children. Society has robbed me of the ability to have children in any
safe environment, where they won't simply be used as someone else's
pawns, just like it has robbed me of everything else I might have. So
how the fuck could I know what that feels like?

# [Reincarnation, Defined In Materialistic Terms](#reincarnation-defined-in-materialistic-terms)

Extrapolating from the baseline for what I'm about to describe, then
one may conceive of reincarnation via metaphor. If one’s psyche is a
compositite of metatypes and archetypes, some more aeternal than
others, then we are all similar to those who've existed before. How
can you tell? Put two people whose composition of types are similar
into similar situations, and if their thought processes are similar,
the outcomes, their responses or their choices should be similar. Is
that really so hard? Again, this extrapolates from the "baseline"
which this article will establish. I am going to compel materialists
to accept at least this much.

### [Reincarnation is Psychosocial Type Theory](#reincarnation-is-psychosocial-type-theory)

Basicaly, in the typological terms of [Type
Theory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Type_theory), then if our
singleton-type representing our individual psyche (as in the mind
within the constraints of our body) is composed of metatypes and
archetypes, then it's straightforward to compare each
other. Furthermore, if we assume these metatypes and archetypes are
draw from an interwoven ontology of psychosocial *-types -- which I
hope to eventual map onto a structure similar to E8 to marry the
physical and metaphysical -- then this only strengthens the
application of my basline. Given this conception, if we are all so
similar to people who’ve existed before, we might as well say we are
“the reincarnation of X, Y or Z” ...

### [The soul is not what you think it is.](#the-soul-is-not-what-you-think-it-is)

There are certainly materialistically derived components of the
soul. If there weren’t, psychology would have produced zero
results. There are patterns to the structure of the psyche: there are
common attributes to psychology; there are common metatypes found in
psychology and sociology; there are common archetypes whitherto extend
the components of our singleton composition of type.

<a name="what-is-the-soul" />

### [What is the Soul?](#what-is-the-soul)

The materialistic components of the soul are disaggregated shards of
identity -- they exist in the self AND they are socially distributed
through society. This requires no supernatural explanation or Woowoo
physics. If you can’t see that, you lack imagination or you do not
understand Carl Jung

There is *no smatter* contained in the above definition of the
soul. The language is intentional. The explanation is clear and if it
isn’t, then you do not undestand the ideas contained therein. The soul
exists, *definitively*. Whether it arises materially or
supernaturally? That is another question entirely. This definition is
a baseline, above which materialists are confined to operate. They
must admit at least this and if they don't it means they are a
materialist not well-educated enough on dynamics of inforamtion from
within a purely material conception of our world. If you do not
understand my definition, then it means you lack either imagination or
intellect. There is no room for subjectivity in this context. The soul
exists. End of story.

It's a great idea and has certainly benefitted the world, but humanity
could really do without all the arrogant euro-centracism. It's a
lie. It's a huge, terrible lie. The west is retarded: literally, we
were *late* to the party. We happened to develop academic institutions
that were protected by enlightenment values to enshrine knowledge
above most other values. *That* is what distinguishes the West and
certainly *not* intellectual superiority. Ironically ... the
englightenment? It's a consequence of the harmonious social fabric
established by Christianity's nearly two millenia of social
engineering.

Why do extreme atheists spit on the memory of Christianity? The most
educated atheists -- i.e. Richard Dawkins -- system of memetics and
holonic information theory implies that spectrally harmonized belief
systems are critical, sociologically.

You lack imagination. Predominantly, that is my greatest critique of
less-educated atheists: they short-circuit their power of imagination
without developing the intellect to critique their own ideas. The more
educated that materialists or atheists are, the more they tend to
rigorously examine their own ideas. Many of them? They are purely
political pawns and I feel sorry for them, son.

The power of ideas? They replicate. They are not bound to an
individual.

I really do enjoy tearing apart rationalists and atheists.  The
pursuit of out-rationalizing their intellect is like a delicacy to me:
I invert your rationalism and use it against you to tear apart your
conceptions of “purely rational thinking” ... they are as inherently
flawed as they are incomplete. I'm sorry if this offends or insults
you, but I have spent a lot of time thinking: I have nothing better to
do with my time. I do not receive any visible respect and I would
really appreciate it. In other words, you aren’t as rational as you
believe yourself to be, so you probably shouldn’t be so *adamantine*
in your response to ideas outside those you accept as “real” or
“proven”.

### [What are Perturbations in Adversarial Network Analysis?](#what-are-perturbations-in-adversarial-network-analysis)

What is a perturbation? Well, whether you can explain the answer to
that depends on what kind of rationalist or atheist you are...

Perturbations allow you to inject noise or random behavior into neural
networks and see what comes out. You're basically comparing a system
-- whose pure states are unknown or perhaps unknowable in totality --
with a more idealized system whose states are more clear. This is
accomplished by injecting noise into the former system to see how the
induced changes move its states towards or away from the the latter,
more ideal system. At each step in machine learning, gradient descent
is typically paired with a kind of simplified perturbation without
some known ideal system to compare it to. This simplified kind of
perturbation has noise whose magnitude is controlled via the
algorithms hyperparameters, which control the learning rate.

###

Let's say Alice and Bob are both working on a college project to
produce the best image-classification network -- for a exam credit in
a course on machine learning. What is exam credit? Fuck if I
know. Anyways, they are both fairly rational and that's also entirely
beside the point. Perhaps the previous three sentences were
irrational. Do I care? Fuck no. Anyways, Alice get's real smart and
hacks Bob's computer. Bob is smart and reads Kaggle posts. He finds a
typical Deep neural net strategy. Every time he trains the network,
Alice has embedded malware that sends his training weights to her
computer. She's running the same network: that's what almost everyone
on Kaggle does; they run the best network.

Alice is real smart though, so she decides to construct a General
Adversarial Network on top of the training weights that Bob's network
produces. Her goal is actually to fuck Bob's grade in the course
because she's a true adversary. So, her adversarial network does
typical
[GAN](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Generative_adversarial_network)
things: it has one half to "generate candidates" that the other half
must classify as being real training data or fake training data. Her
GAN departs from the traditional network: her goal is to train an
algorithm capable of interpolation and extrapolation along Bob's
hyperplane. In this way, she can hack Bob's weights at the last minute
(before he submits) and nudge them slightly so that he fails and she
gets the top spot in the class. Yeh, Alice wants to fuck Bob.

What's any of this have to do with perturbation? Well, in order to
understand how her GAN can manipulate Bob's network's theta-weights,
it needs to be able to construct the hyperplane from Bob's trainings
assuming he runs the network hundreds of times. From perturbatation of
Bob's stolen theta-weights, Alice's "Hyperplane-Adversarial-Network"
can perturbate those theta-weight values and attempt to guess the
how the total score for the network will change.

This is adversarial signals analysis for neural networks. *IT REQUIRES
IRRATIONAL, NON-DETERMINISTIC STOCHASTIC BEHAVIOR TO MAKE ASSESSMENTS
OF BOB'S NETWORK*. You have to inject noise to see how the adversary
responds. This is true for artificial behavior

- push to the rest of the outline:

- when the rationalist's additively constructed beliefs render
  themselves overly-deterministic, then they not only become more
  predictable, but become less capable of predicting the behavior of
  others. perturbation of noise is required to scan the space of your
  adversaries decision trees and forests. There are discretized
  conceptions of decision trees, but also continuous or analytical
  conceptions. These are critical for enhancing the performance of
  machine learning algoritms. BUT! To make inferences about networks
  outside your control *in adversarial signals analysis* requires:
  illogical behavior, non-deterministic behavior, irrational thought

# [The Soul: Your Problem Is The Word](#the-soul-your-problem-is-the-word)

If you don’t define the soul, you can’t say that what I define as the
soul doesn’t exist. You basically don’t like the word. And yes, if you
actually internalize the words written here and extrapolated from my
argument, it what I’m establishing as a baseline extends to
materialistic pan-psychism.

### [The Baseline](#the-baseline)

What am I’m setting as the baseline? information representations are
encoded into the physical configuration of matter, but there is no
clear boundary between one physical container of information and
another. therefore, from one biological machine encoding state and
information to every other nearby biological machine, there is a very
grey line between one "container" of information and other life
forms. therefore: panpsychism. but the soul is in the information
ascribed to one individual (or lifeforms) identity as it is
distributed among other nearby (or faraway) lifeforms. however, the
information that defines an individual is not completely contained
within that biological entity. their true self are the disaggregated
shards reflected through society. therefore, my self extends (via our
interactions) into the reflections of my image that exist within you
and are completely out of my control.

Those who become aware of their soul, their true extent of self
outside their brain -- and can exert control over it! -- are far better
adapted to interacting within society than those who cannot, whether
you believe these ideas to be true or not! this is partially what is
so *dangerous* about the *ablation of causality*: computationally, the
problem of knowing these aspects of self extending into society become
increasingly recalcitrant. even before considering the introduction of
non-physicalized artificial entities, because social media and the
internet disrupt our perception of causality, then it becomes
impossible to know the reverberations of self throughout this material
panpsychism. therefore it becomes difficult to distinguish or know
one’s identity as it is perceived by others -- or to know this
materally dependent definition of soul.

Again, if you don’t understand what’s written above, then you may not
understand Carl Jung. I still have a lot to learn about his ideas
myself, but I at least have imagined the social precipitation of
psychological archetypes.

they want "free" things, without understanding that free of financial
cost doesn't mean free of social cost.

### [Ontological Triumvirate of Sociophysical Resources](#ontological-triumvirate-of-sociophysical-resources)

Social resources are intrinsically interconnected with financial
resources: one merely transduces from forms of one to forms of the
other. There is a third component to this ontology of sociophysical
resource-types: informational resources. The triumvirate: financial,
social and informational resources, where the first two are
overlapping subsets of the last. There is no financial cost without
social consequences. There are no financial or social actions without
informational consequences. Did you bother to think about this or did
you merely read a copy of Marx's genius *19th century* genius [Das
Capital](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Das_Kapital) without
comprehending 20th century history? Nor do you understand economics
pragmatically ... oh that's great. Now you want to dictate to me to
act deterministically: so you can predict me; psychologicall abuse me;
plot to socially engineer me and everyone else like me? Go shove your
fucking Marxist dialectic up the materialistic ass that birthed it:
your own.

Socialism will lead to Communism in *America*, which *does not happen
without undermining strategic economic and geopolitical imperatives
for American domestic and foreign policy.* You lose, go read a fucking
book.

Oh boy! I got myself started on the Marxist-Leninists who think their
petty revolutions are anything other than power changing hands from
one social structure to another. The only difference is that their
power structures do not allow for the conservation of value/resource
in financial form, since saving rates plummet in proto/communist
societies. Therefore, people still exchange value in society, but they
end up **bartering with social resources** (i.e. corruption) instead
of being capable of conserving stores of value independent from the
exertion of power by corrupt officials.

COMMUNISM IS A LIE. EAT A DICK, LENINISTS.
