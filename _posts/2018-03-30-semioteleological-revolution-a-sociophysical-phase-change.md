### Social Information Consensus

- social information consensus (& dynamics thereof) as it relates to:
  - whether information systems are overdetermined/underdetermined
  - validation/assumptions of consensus/coherence among social nodes
    - do social nodes realize that information systems:
      - have reached social consensus
      - could/not reach social consensus
      - are likely to seem overdetermined/underdetermined amongst
        social nodes
    - i.e. "when we all know that *what we all know* means there are 3
      different ways to verify some pieces of information"
      - when this is true, the information has propagated through the
        network and some means of validation are readily available --
        *and everyone knows that*
        - the system can be said to be overdetermined
        - but in this case, information related to (and along the
          boundary of) the socially distributed information system in
          question is:
          - more rigid and less susceptible to sudden change
          - if the system does change, everyone involved can
            anticipate how it will change.
       - however, when the social distribution of some information
         system is curtailed, constrained or simply doesn't propagate,
         then the system's pieces are poorly socially distributed.
         - it is underdetermined: and everyone knows that the related
           information
         - it is thus more flexible, more susceptible to change that
           is difficult to anticipate.
       - when seeking consensus or verification of the coherence of
         information, if the system as it is distributed socially is
         underdetermined, people might find themselves saying:
         - "i don't even know what questions to ask" as though they
           aren't sure how to extrapolate along the boundary of the
           information system
  - when aniticipating change of an information system to retain
    flexibility, it is generally more advantageous that the system is
    underdetermined, specifically in how it appears to specific people
    or types of people
    - i.e. when you are pulling the wool over someone's eyes, you
      don't want specific pieces of information to be readily
      available to them.
      - or the ways the information system can be adapted are limited
        - this means there are fewer believable lies that you can tell
          them.
        - or, if you are using the tactic of creating truthful
          disinformation, it becomes harder to fake consistency to
          deceive the person.

### Complexity of Social Information Systems and Decidability

- decidibility in computer science, for deterministic programs
  - how does is this concept different for non-deterministic systems?

#### What does decidability mean for Sociology and Communication

- The process of information consensus and complexity of Information
  State-Space -- how do these relate to the notions of decidibility in
  social information systems?
  - introduce slang as an example: how does it propagate? what
    determines the selection/retention of morphemes with duplicitous
    connotation?
    - decidibility problems in slang usage
  - how does this apply to the notion of pattern langauges? how much
    additional structure can be imposed onto language/communication?
    - when words/concepts are remapped with too much complexity, no
      one knows what you mean or which direction you're coming from or
      which side you're on.
    - this isn't cogent to a discussion on slang because that's
      developed ad hoc. it's more important to the examination of
      argots/cryptolects as they are used for the advancement of
      political agendas and for belligerence in society.

#### Assertion: ANY Assumptions reduce the complexity of the informational state space

- better term for "assumptions"
- this assertion must be qualified by:
  - validity of the assumption
  - ethics of the assumption
  - efficiency/utility of the assumption
  - [informational parity] of the assumption
    - i.e. is the structure of the assumption clear, simple and
      definite? does it require parameterization?

#### Correlate to the "Triumvirate" framework for delineating governmental/social systems

- in the more extreme configuratoins of governmental systems, the
  influential tend to:
  - (1) construct abstractions (and socially distribute them) so that
    specific concepts are clearly defined and so people in society can
    predicate their actions/statements/beliefs upon these
    abstractions/assumptions
  - (2) leverage tradition (either old or new) and generally socially
    engineer.
    - this is effective by reducing the informational/schematic
      complexity
  - (3) concentrate the majority of info/schema into highly focused
    spectra. they try to force beliefs upon society

### Decidability & Schematic Complexity complicates a society's reflection upon:

- (1) that society in relation to itself
- (2) that society in relation to the external
  - this is particularly problematic when the society cannot fathom
    the nature/state of external factors, as they relate to its
    prosperity or demise

- that is, as the complexity of information systems expand, the
  ability for a society's leaders and individuals to quickly make
  decisions that are effective and serve the interests of the general
  public begins to break down.


### Concept of Elasticity, as applied to Social Information Systems

- as the motion is more generally defined in math, what is elasticity?
  - what does this mean for the social distribution of information?
  - how does this relate to the distribution of attention and the
    absorption/retention of information?



- aetiology

- epistemic mitosis
- epistemicide
  - the systematic destruction of information structures deemed
    heretical. the eradication or culling of instantiations of
    forbidden knowledge in society.

#### Evolution of Epistemic Structures

- evolutionary dynamics and speciation in epistemic structures
  - entropy/enthalpy in the evolution/distribution of epistemic
    structures, for types/metatypes. the potential for diversity in
    epistemic structures is balanced by the influence of enthalpy on
    the speciation of information as it propagates.

#### How Social Information Consensus is useful

- social information censensus and the effects its outcomes can have
  on people's lives.
  - those with social/financial resources have the upper hand when
    provoking/manipulating information consensus.
    - the outcome of information consensus can impact your ability to
      secure social/financial resources in the future
    - how can informational resources be utilized to affect/predict
      information consensus?
  - once a consensus has been established and distributed, it becomes
    difficult to overturn. for every instantiation of the information,
    the vessel of that information needs to choose to modify their
    beliefs (or store information in the case of social media &
    digitized information)

#### Bilingual Readings for eludication of epistemic meaning via Semantic Hendiadys

- leveraging bilingual readings for a kind of semantic hendiadys.
  - concerning epistemic convolution: reachiing the authentic semantic
    intent of an author by attempting to find the middle ground
    between two transations.

####

- if you seek true liberation and other people subsist by siphoning
  your sociophysical resources -- i.e. they take the value work they
  underpay you for, or they plan on deciving you to manipulate you to
  gain sociophysical influence -- then your liberation is expensive to
  their sociophysical potential energy.
  - your cage is not made of steel: there is no physical lock. you
    might spend your entire life looking for a physical key, but there
    is no key in the outside world. this is a fool's errand. the keys
    to your liberation come from within.
  - if you understood the structure of your own cage and freed
    yourself, they would no longer be able to use you. or they'd no
    longer be able to siphon quite as much energy from you. so, when
    this liberation happens on a social scale, it terrifies the
    parasites that completely subsist on the efforts of others.
    - not all people who occupy higher strata in social hierarchies
      qualify as parasites. it really depends on how much value they
      contribute to society and how much blood they suck. obviously,
      so hierarchy and structure in society is unavoidable; managers
      and people with authority are a necessary evil.
    - yet, quite a few high-ranking people in the high-classes subsist
      unfairly on value derived by those toiling below them. as for
      those people whose livelihoods depends not on hard-work but on
      precariously maintained deception, their lives are ironically
      less secure than that of the common person and the honest
      person.
      - their livelihoods depend on projecting deception -- they
        cannot continue to suck blood without continuing to deceive.
        the moment this illusion is shattered with significance and
        permanence, all those parasites in high places come tumbling
        down. from here on out, they must suffer with the karma of
        their deceptions that were made visible to everyone.
      - these people fear this. they know this. the object of their
        fear: the truth heard so loudly it can no longer be suppressed
        and forever preempts any illusions they'd seek to construct in
        its place.
    - they will claim that the truth is so incredulous, it is not
      worth considering. yet, then, why do they fear it? they will try
      to do whatever they can to prevent you from looking at the
      truth, to acknowledge the truth, to speak the truth.
      - but if it's so incredulous that it's unacknowledgable, how do
        you prevent people from speaking the truth that which cannot
        be acknowledged? how does one distribute knowledge defining
        what is censored without having to reference this censored
        knowledge?
      - this is why they have to protect their own lies with yet more
        lies; it is why 21st Century America is barely afloat in a
        deluge of deception today.
      - (They are struggling against truths that are so threatening to
        them, that people threatened for even acknowledging components
        and propositions of these truths.)
    - a ship with a hole this massive will eventually capsize, no
      matter how hard we fight against it. the danger: by refusing to
      acknowledge that hole, we're wasting valuable time and energy.
      - if you cannot acknowledge a severe problem, how do you address
        it? we are wasting valuable time running around with our pants
        on fire.
        - The deafening tumult you hear on social media will no doubt
          fuel jokes regarding american Spinelessness and
          obliviousness for decades. It's going to be hard to live
          down.

TODO: reorganize this

Stoicism has influenced my writing significantly, especially its
emphasis on becoming stronger by overcoming struggle.

-

One of the areas where i focus the most is in addressing how the rapid
pace of technological development in the modern era results in a
unstable sociocultural turbulence. Until the modern era, myth and
religion helped society meet the need of propagating values systems
between generations by establishing belief systems that focus on
teleological relationships between phenomena. The way that myths map
symbols/signs to various teleological relationships amongst phenomena
is something i call semioteleology.

These semioteleological mappings established by myth provide an
efficient means of propagating belief systems. Religions provide real
value for their followers via teleological emphasis of the
relationships amongst phenomena, which allows people to simply
understand the world and operate within it without the need to
rationally comprehend the inner workings of those phenomena. Moreover
the semioteleological mappings of myth and religion provide an
epistemically compressed structure of beliefs that does not need to
map with complete parity to the scientific explanations of those
phenomena. This means these belief systems require less time to
absorb, are more likely to be passed on completely, are more likely to
achieve spectral coherence amongst their followers and are more likely
to exhibit “sociophysical resonance” in the way that the information
“vibrates” amongst people.

As science precludes the potential for faith - i.e. “God is dead” - it
outmodes many existing religious belief systems or at least undermines
their authority. It does so simply by disproving their basis (even
though I believe there are no singularly correct interpretations of
religious texts, especially singularly correct literal
interpretations). Science does so without replacing religious belief
systems and without regard for the niche for values propagation that
religious systems/institutions filled in society. Moreover, as
technology evolves more rapidly, the pace of sociocultural evolution
also accelarates, whereby these myths and belief systems lose their
power unless humanity decides to artificially reorient themselves
against these “natural” sociocultural evolutionary dynamics primarily
arising via technology. This tends to further dilute, debase and
ablate the belief systems we use to propagate values & moral systems
between generations.

Why call them the Anti-Santa? You start off believing they're not
real, but once you become about 30 years old, it's impossible to not
believe in them if you're not clueless. When you believe in them, if
you're good, they being you lots of coal. If you're real bad, they'll
bring you presents and then use your sins to destroy you later. They
don't come down your chimney, they sneak in your house and close the
flue, but only if you're worth the effort to cover their tracks. The
Illuminati almost never directly does *anything* because invisibility
is paramount: you can fight what you believe exists.

There is no one group though, why is partially why it's so easy to

manifestation of evil that projects itself into the world through the
collective unconscious exigencies of the nature of power combined with
certain aspects of the human condition.

# [What Does Metaphysics Have To Do With The Illuminati, Anyways?](#what-does-metaphysics-have-to-do-with-the-illuminati)

Furthermore, if you're trapped with the false paradigm of metaphysics
that ascends primarily from the material, you can never actually
believe they exist, rationally, which is why that false paradigm is
soo convenient to the Illuminati. This is partially why western
cultures will often present the opposite paradigm as heresy: because
if you believe in idealistic metaphysics, you actually can see what is
happening around you. If you don't, you're simply a powerless consumer
feeding the rich. This is yet another reason why Marxism is precisely
its own antithesis.  Marxism is not liberating, it is enslaving.

Idealistic metaphysics has its own problems, but new age voodoo is
easy enough to dismiss with a healthy dose of rationalism. Another
serious problem is that, once you sociologically extrapolate it, the
after the order du jour is established, your place in society is
almost entirely determined by your place at birth and the
sociophysical circumstances that surround you. If that such world
order or state order serves the people well, this is a very good
thing. If it does not, it can end up being horrible. As long as the
social contract must be upheld, the people are likely being served
well by their state. However, a well established order extrapolated
from idealistic metaphysics is difficult to disrupt.

What is an example of such an order? Japan. It is an incredibly strong
society with a rich culture and an incredibly strong sense of shared
identity, where even the language reflects this understanding of
metaphysics. It was only possible for Japan to develop all of this
because it was geographically isolated from the mainland, but China
shares many of these same qualities. Taoism and Shinto provide
interesting reflection on these ideas.

### [Materialistic Metaphysics Epistemologically Detaches The Followers From A Prevalent Sociocultural Order](#materialistic-metaphysics-epistemologically-detaches-the-followers-from-a-prevelant-sociocultural-order)

Therefore, there's not much chance for revolution and progress in the
class struggle without sociometaphysical churn: you need both. You
must *use* both the idealistically and materially derived
conceptualizations of metaphysics. Yet, the stability of a society is
incredibly important, so if the philosophical underpinnings of your
language, culture and state are not acceptably stable and strong, you
will not have a stable society.

They are basically the same process starting from opposite ends, in a
way. If I had to choose, what would I prefer? Idealistic metaphysics
because it is the truth and the truth sets you free. But some truths
are created and in themselves only are derived from happenings in the
material world: history. Of course history is truth that you must deal
with, but it is not THE Truth. The Truth is everywhere: it is timeless
and spaceless. The Truth echoes from beyond the material world and it

centuries. The poor twit that doesn't learn about philosophy is
someone else's clueless pawn lost in a maze they can't even see. When
you try to acknowledge that labyrinth for what it is or manage to
significantly call the public's attention to it, you are quickly

<a name="what-is-socioepistemological-churn" />

# [What Is Socioepistemic Churn](#what-is-socioepistemological-churn)

Socioepistemic flux and churn covers regional and sociohierarcical
changes in how people understand the world through belief systems and
epistemological structures. Socioepistemology studies the social
aspects of epistemic flux and churn, as it occurs in geographic
networks and logical networks.

Democratic societies, those with a high degree of geosocial
interconnection, and those who promote freedom of speech always have
more socioepistemic flux and churn. The constant influx and outflow of
ideas accelerates the precipitation of the development of new
ideas. As long as this churn promotes innovation and economic
development, it leads to prosperity and the profound degree of
connection is certainly a strength. When the democratic societies lose
their way by becoming demoralized and separated from the source of
their prosperity, the stakeholders and powerbrokers become susceptible
to foreign influence. If this happens while external powers enchant
the internal powers, rendering them blind to the need to protect their
own internal sources of vitality, then the external powers can subvert
the nation, causing them to squander every advantage they have. The
victims of this general strategy of subversion will love every moment
of pissing away all the advantages they have. Why? Demoralized and
disillusioned, they no longer recognize the true sources of their
strength. One generation later, the nation succumbs to internal
struggles.

### (Modes of Epistemic Processing)

Both the macrocosmic and microcosmic aspects of socioepistemic flux
and churn inform systemic understanding of how various accepted
realities of individuals changes in response to what they've
experienced in life, typologically. That is, there are large-scale and
small scale dynamics in socioepistemic flux. Since all instantiations
of epistemic structures be contained within some entity, then how each
individual's epistemic structures change in response to stimulus
depend on how that individual chooses to perceive the metaphysical.

Zooming out to larger scales of society, the variety of available
modes to envisage epistemic structures then presents varied dynamics
based on how uniformly groups choose to process and root epistemic
structures. Does a group of individuals process and extend knowledge
structures using a restricted set of epistemological tools? Or does a
group choose to perceive and manipulate structures of knowledge
diversely, each in their own way? If so, then they gain the benefit of
leveraging the diversity of modes for processing epistemic
structures. Therefore, collectively, the set of conclusions that group
can reach is wider than that of the group who chooses to perceive
knowledge, information and philosophy using only a narrow set of
rules. In the past, when communication was moreso bound to areas of
limited geographic scale, this meant that the modes of thought were
also geographically bound. Before the modern era, it was more
difficult to leverage the diversity of thought.

#### (1) Whither Are An Individual's Epistemic Structures Rooted?

- rooting epistemic structures in the metaphysical
  - either they are bound to the material or to the ideal.
  - but also, the individual hosting the knowledge structures may not
    reason about how they choose to root knowledge or they may do so
    irrationally

- The churn of social consequences mainly resulting from how epistemic
  structures are rooted in either the idealistic or ideal conceptions
  of the metaphsyical.

- describe the major consequences between these two epistemic premises
  of knowledge
  - all knowledge is primarily aeternal or all knowledge is primarily
    worldly
    - this is an oversimplification that does not account for people
      who never think about this. once you settle on either, your
      decision allows you to vastly simplify epistemic extrapolation.
    - there is another edge case, which is that only *some* subset of
      knowledge is aeternal. From this kernel of knowledge, everything
      else can be extrapolated. Even logically irrational structures
      can be virtualized within it.
  - assuming that

- this section must distinguish between how people who primarily
  adhere to materialistic or idealistic conceptions of metaphysics
  envision the potential movement forward.
  - connect to the subsequent section on the "clarity" of potential
    futures and the available paths thereto.

- an individual's (philosophical) framework for logic and epistemology
  corresponds to the structure of neurological representations of
  their knowledge and thoughts
  - this metaphysical "rooting" of epistemic structures and knowledge
    impacts the shapes and internetworking of the neurological
    representations of those ideas
    - (where the neurological representations aren't necessarily the
      physical shapes of neural networks per se, but moreso the
      electrical patterns corresponding to the neurological reflection
      of the ideas referenced in someone's thoughts)
    - mental constructs and the epistemic structures therein must
      correspond to neurological representations of those constructs

#### (TODO: move this somewhere else)

  - it's fascinating to reason about how this extends to irrationally
    or illogically structured ideas, especially when these ideas are
    projected to social scale. in states like the Soviet Union, people
    were forced to reason about state-mandated delusiions that
    resemble the fake news of our era.
    - when someone's delusional ideas about reality begin to have very
      real effects on your reality and life experience, if you can't
      reason about those specific false and/or irrational ideas
      projected by perhaps the state or some charismatic leader, then
      you can suffer real consequences.
  - usually, when a individual is forced to believe something that's
    false, they usually either compartmentalize it, convoluting their
    actions and statements around it. Depending on the nature of the
    false beliefs they are compelled to accept project belief
    - the other (usual way) individuals usually handle this is to
      swallow the pill whole and believe the false beliefs.
  - what happens when an entire society is compelled to believe these
    fantasies?
    - e.g. the government forces them to believe something like `2 + 2
      = 5`, especially when it's something that's difficult to
      believe, but important to not contradict. In the past, when this
      happens, the state compels people to believe these untruths and
      holds an individual's upward motion through social strata as
      motivation. the state can decide to make or break an
      individual's life based on how that person's statements and
      actions belie their their beliefs about such mandated untruths.
    - in this case, all those who want to be moderately successful in
      life or who want to avoid being tormented for discussing taboo
      subjects must walk on eggshells and be capable to extrapolating
      from irrationally structured or illogically constructed
      ideas. otherwise, regardless of their talent or capacity to
      contribute to society, they will be deprived of the
      opportunities for obtaining influence in society, if not
      tormented outright.
      - this is essentially conflict over the social distribution of
        epistemic structures: it's a clash between the interests of
        the powerfule whose worldviews descend from and depend on
        specific information remaining true at least appearing to be
        true.
        - and especially the consistency of that information in the
          context of the worldview. information warfare always
          preceeds social conflict and military conflict. to control
          belief is to control types of people's orientation towards
          the world. it is to control their wants, desires, apparent
          needs and attention; change the prevelant beliefs in a
          nation and you can lens or funnel the sociophysical energy
          of those individuals, which can lead to cooperation or
          conflict.

- the consistency of the narratives and components of the dominant
  worldview is critical. no one wants the seams to start
  showing. absent some obvious compelling external threat to
  promulgate falsehoods and/or irrational beliefs, when the seams
  start to show, people become demoralized quickly. we seek truth
  because truth is simple, truth is socially convergent (i.e. truth is
  truth everywhere and to everyone) and, most crucially, (truth is
  useful to society). being compelled to deal with superstitions and
  falsehoods cripples our capacity to advance.
  - when you're forced to walk on eggshells every time you get close
    to censored information or people, it stifles communication,
    promotes social conflict and creates potential for dissention.
  - those illogical components of belief systems foisted onto
    citizens: how useful are they really? it may help you cling onto
    power, if you can just compel people to keep swallowing those
    pills.
    - what about the


#### (2) (mutating epistemic structures)

  - (2) and in how whether the knowledge structures are primarily
    constructed from additive logic ("pure rationalism"), subtractive
    logic ("i only know for sure the set of things that is
    impossible"), a combination of both, or convolution of epistemic
    structures.
    - also: spectral evaluation and statistical dissolution of
      epistemic uncertainty (spectral methods)
      - related to spectral graph theory. however vague they may seem,
        the epistemic structures of knowledge may be compared
        alongside that of known dictionary of common epistemic
        structure meta/types
      - rather than being having some truly novel structure, all
        epistemic structures for new or unrecognized phenomena are
        much more likely to resemble -- partially or completely -- the
        nature of some known epistemic type or metatype that already
        exists.
        - because of this, methods from spectral graph theory can be
          used to direct investment of energy towards resolving
          uncertainty with regard to information and knowledge.
          - that is, spectral epistemic resolution doesn't solve any
            problems for you or make anything certain, but instead
            rapidly carves away at the stochastic space of the
            unknown.
    - epistemological development in science is primarily additive,
      - whereas the statement of a novel hypothesis is meant to test
        some subtractive epistemological space that can be dissolved
        away with clarity to reveal some new insight which can be
        additively positioned on top of existing knowledge.
        - that is, the assertion in a novel hypothesis is something
          that is not necessarily known to be true or untrue and is
          instead something which is assumed to be provable.

    - how to methodologically combine both additive/subtractive
      epistemological structures, along with epistemic convolution, to
      congeal information using statistical methods (i.e. analysis of
      information graphs and information networks)
      - this process allows you to cyclically reiterate the
        information/knowledge graph where you use
        additive/subtractive/consensus methods, augmented by
        statistical analysis of the network, to expand the graph and
        determine your level of confidence of information
      - using this idea as the basis of an algorithm that optimally(?)
        expands the information/knowledge graph by directing the
        computation energy & time or by directing the acquisition of
        knowledge.

[Noumenon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Noumenon#Schopenhauer's_critique)

### (3?) Epistemic Morphology: Continuum Mechanics for the Metaphysical


- (3) inferences based on the likely differential of epistemic
  structures. kant already developed this to some extent, if you
  understand his ideas. Kant's writing on epistemology essentially
  established a framework for reasoning about how knowledge evolves in
  the short term.

#### What is known? How is it known?

#### What are reasonable extrapolations based on what is known?

#### What can be assumed to be a believable extrapolation, to various types of people, based on the distribution of knowledge in a society?

- Kant's work on epistemology was critical towards the West's
  understanding of how ideas would evolve in the near future, if you
  apply the concept of a Kantian Category to the short-term evolution
  of ideas. Here the Kantian category represents the space just beyond
  the known. By extrapolating the development of knowledge, the next
  set of ideas still partially occluded is the Kantian category that
  the current trajectory of knowledge must extend in to.

- for a system with epistemic structures that correspond to
  information & beliefs, must the structures in that system always
  move continuously to some epistemic mutation representing a member
  of the kantian category?
  - in other words, is it possible to serendipitously skip beyond the
    boundary of conceivable as-yet-unrevealed ideas?

- for epistemic structures, how to get from here to there?
  - especially regarding structures that are socially distributed
  - this is complicated considering epistemic structures in limited
    social contexts. this is a problem that tutors and teachers
    encounter every day:
    - how do i ascertain the structure of a student's knowledge, so
      that i present them with the most valuable information so that
      they begin to understand the content clearly and confidently?
      - this particular question is even moreso confounded when:
        - the student's set of knowledge is unclear or limited
        - the student perceives the content incorrectly
        - when someone perceives the content irrationally
    - a successful teacher identifies what specific set of epistemic
      structures that a student has and identifies a path of
      engagements that leads the student towards internalizing the
      correct set of information

- by reasoning about the likely epistemological expansion,
  - one can reapply the previous two "modes" towards inferences based
    on differential dynamics of the development of knowledge.


==========


- (TODO: move to a footnote)
- how to ascertain the structure of someone's knowledge: this is a
  problem i encountered when trying to teach people how to jamskate.
  - later in life, it's incredibly frustrating knowing that people
    sought to prevent me becoming a mentor by painting me as a bad
    example or simply an insufferable crazy-person
  - why? because if you're not allowed to teach anyone anything, then
    you don't learn how to teach.
    - learning about the processes of teaching effectively is critical
      towards understanding social behaviors and understanding
      leadership in general.
- i never internally modeled the information in other people's minds,
  even in high school. i had nearly zero conceptualization of how
  people thought about things. i could never leverage this information
  socially and i did not exhibit behaviors to ellicit information
  about someone's beliefs.
  - when i was 18-20, i had nearly zero conception of the moves that
    other jamskaters were capable of performing. i didn't seek to
    acquire this socially relevant information and i didn't obtain it
    unless it was presented to me.
  - this supports my assertion that I have asperger's. now I realize
    that it was impossible for other people to not realize this, which
    is OK when someone is a kid, but as they develop psychologically
    as an adult, it should be pretty apparent.
  - when you reach adulthood and you have zero patterns for behaviors
    that help you make assertions for social beliefs, it means you
    likely have zero emotional intelligence and are not capable of
    forming healthy relationships, platonic or otherwise.
    - you're helpless when it comes to social life. if you are at odds
      with other people in an adversarial manner who deceive you and
      prevent you from obtaining necessary information, there is
      literally nothing you can do.
  - this is tragic when it is reality and there are people in your
    life who seek to prevent you from having an accurate diagnosis *AT
    ALL COSTS* because it would make *them* look bad.
    - in terms of my personal psychological development, i wasn't
      exactly cooperative towards engaging in behaviors that would
      result in positive changes. however, this was only relevant
      *before* i smoked weed because afterwards, many people in my
      life gradually began to believe that i would be mostly useful as
      an example to justify anti-drug propaganda.

### [Dominating Consensus Reality In A World Where The Only Constant Is Change](#dominating-consensus-reality-in-a-world-where-the-only-constant-is-change)

- TODO: change the headers in this section

In the 1950's, the iron curtain cast its shadow across Europe, forming
the basis of geographical socioepistemic schism. East and west of the
curtain, there were born two separate worlds: one defending the ideals
of rationalism and free exchange of ideas; the other experimenting
with communism, destroying all ideas outside that thought which was
approved by the Party. All epistemic structures that did not
contribute to the growth, sustainance or sword of the Communist Party
in Eastern Europe were ruthlessly irradiated by the application of
sociophysical energy intended to coerce all vessels of thought to
cohere with the Party's ideals. To prevent the introduction of outside
thought, which would prove as competition too vicious for these frail
epistemic structures, a near-total sociophysical barricade cast of the
steel of an Iron Curtain that physically prevented the contamination
of ideal communist society with exterior ideas. This locked human
thought into the ineffible manacles of totalitarianism, suffocating
innovation and inevitably resulting slowly and steadily in economic
suicide. Such is the fate of those who refuse to acknowledge reality.

Everywhere, there is continual conflict over consensus reality, even
in open societies with free speech. Why? Commanding consensus reality
as it has congealed amongst the populus allows authorities to
determine how epistemic belief structures begin to extrapolate with
subsequent circulations of the sun and stars. Until socioepistemic
structures have congealed, extrapolations cannot be certain. Struggle
in sociophysical systems is a probabilistic pursuit; any events and
event types or knowledge and knowedge types which can be rendered as
close to certainty as possible are critical. As a member of an
authority in society, congealing socioepistemic structures across vast
groups of people allows you to ascertain that you are certain of the
structure of thought amongst segments of the population. We see the
need to know in the market demand for focus groups and
surveys. Leaders need to know what kinds of thought is representative
in their populus or followers.  Focus groups and surveys are one means
of socioepistemic information acquisition.

How does conflict and competition over socioepistemic consensus play
out in open societies? Political debate is mild conflict over
consensus reality: through the exposition of discourse amongst one or
more political authorties, the audience of such debate can hope to
approach some consensus on policy, its motivations and their
confidence in policy. For example, what is the true cause of sky-high
health care costs in the United States? Manage to court Republicans
and Democrats into a straightforward debate on this issue and you'll
see a perfect example of conflict in the pursuit of epistemic
consensus. Liberals and conservatives need their followers to reach
some consensus on what they believe, so that they can lead their
followers to push for change.

Aristotle's work *Politics* describes effective methods in the
struggle towards true progress on issues in a democracy, though the
tactics and strategies which he describes also work in other
societies. *Politics* is not about what you know, what you believe,
your objectives, precisely.  Instead *Politics* concerns separating
yourself -- your words and your actions -- from your goals, so that
you are most effectively capable of attaining your goals. You must
identify the path(s) most likely to result in true change in
society. Doing so involves not just coordinating your self, per se,
but the actions of your group and supporters, so that you are most
likely to bring about the changes you want to see. However, I believe
that such a path for you and your followers is most likely to succeed
in meaningful ways when you do not separate your self from your
methods -- i.e. you do not separate your tactics, your actions, your
words from the goals your movement seeks to attain. In other words,
*Politics* offers great approaches for informing the dissonance in
appearance and reality between that of your goals and of your actions,
**but when you actualize the embodiment of the change you seek in the
world, you are most likely to attain it.**

> *Be* the change that you seek in the world." -- Mahatma Ghandi

Far more critical than winning a debate is the need the convince
people who are not your followers that some key presumptions of their
policy or pragma are incorrect. This ability to convince
non-supporters that the ideas they disagree with are correct or what
you propose least worthy of prompting reevaluation of what they know
-- if this is strong, your words can provoke true change in politics,
in democracy and in any forum. How do you do this? With empathy. You
must be capable of empathizing and internalizing all ways of belief in
an issue. Your adversaries that are wrong -- how do you know why they
are wrong if you do not know what they know? And if you do not know
this, how can you position your statements to reach them *where they
are* to bring them to your side?  As for discourse surrounding
specific subjects or questions, if it is forbidden, impractical or
destabalizing to the debate, is it any surprise that we see only
limited progress? Then, once you realize that the very ways in which
these issues are presented are in themselves architected to stall any
progress, you will likely become extremely cynical and furious, as I
have become. The ways in which people are encouraged to approach the
discourse of specific issues: are controlled and designed to either
stall out progress or prevent progress against the grain, so to speak.



In Nassim Taleb's book Antifragile -- a work whose ideas have
transformed my understanding of philosophy and life via creatively
applied statistics -- he posits that technology introduces many
apparent changes as meaningful which are merely superficial changes in
the decor or facade.[^nassim-tebar-true-technological-change]

> "Tonight I will be meeting friends in a restaurant (tavernas have
> existed for at least 25 centuries). I will be walking there wearing

Similarly, what seems at first to be some vast socioepistemic change
to consensus reality for some issue is instead superficial "change to
the wallpaper." Instead, interests vested in that issue ultimately
render consequential such changes by present the system's superficial
compromise as a significant change, intending to gradually dilute and
refashion the system into its former image. In doing so, those powers
that be have dispelled the accumulated sociophysical energy which
drove for real change. This potential is diverted like the floodwaters
into a dam's calculated spillway, designed preciessly to handle such
spillover. Thereafter, forces driving for change becomes placated
enough to rest on their laurels, pleased with the new decor.

When your tactics are informed to handle such diversionary tactics and
instead threaten to make real changes, you will need excellent
camoflage to mask your intent. Instead play on your adversaries
cynicism while remaining aware of *their magninimous capacity to cause
the world's systems to appear to have changed*, while gradually
stifling all true change. Beware this: such superficial changes --
political, socioepistemic or otherwise -- these changes are expensive
all the same. True change cannot be attained without struggle: those
who hold the keys will entice you with bait-and-switch every time
while demonizing the groups who venture dangerously close to true
change.

  computing and office software in the 1990's.

- consensus reality (as a long-term information as part of a
  context/frame)
  - deviation from a single consensus reality

  - gradual psychosocial migration of a group from one consensus
    reality to another

      a web applications data migration from one SQL database schema
      to the next.
    - what do such socioepistemological migrations entail? how do you
      systematically transform the schemata of various social groups?
      the answers are dark.
    - How do these people handle threats to consensus reality breaking
      world? what is "the" world anyways? Is it truly the physical
      first? Or doesn't the physical congeal itself to reflect the
      metaphysical?

### [What **Might** You Conceive With Your Mind?]()

- socioepistemological churn:
  - how people's conceptions of society reinforce or diffuse the
    "clarity" of potential futures
    - so, with idealistic conceptions of metaphysics, the
      metatypological components of possible futures congeal into a
      set of more clearly defined, convergent possible futures.
      - because these possible futures have converged into a
        profoundly smaller set of possibilities, it becomes much
        easier to extrapolate and understand the paths foward from the
        present into the future.
    - people who have a materialistic conception of metaphysics tend
      to ignore many of the components of the future which are assumed
      to be exigent, pre-ordained or necessary.
      - instead, they focus on the divergent paths forward, only
        accepting what is in front of them. they focus on the power of
        choice that they have to change their lives. (ignorance is
        bliss)
      - individuals determine their own fates based on what each
        individual believes about the world, therefore which
        conception of metaphysics they choose, if any, to base their
        worldview upon dictates how they view their own reality and
        the range of what is possible.
        - each individual's understanding of how free will might
          affect their life depends on whether the paths available in
          their worldview are primarily convergent via idealistic
          metaphysics or divergent via materialistic metaphysics
      - when you zoom out to greater sociological scales, (this
        phenomonon) determines how groups of people view the range of
        paths available and whether they are free from the chains of
        fate.
      - so people who are primarily materialistic will exhibit a
        greater response to socioepistemic
    - for better or worse, people who accept their fate can be trapped
      within a idealistic reality that is detached from their
      individual capacity.
      - when groups of people believe that their fates are sealed,
        each individual is much less likely to act against authority
        for their own benefit or to join a group of people.
        - (video of that one girl dancing at a festival, and suddenly
          many people start dancing)
      - when groups of people believe the idea that their fates might
        be sealed is ludicrous, they will never simply fall in
        line. they will always struggle forwards and work hard to
        change their circumstances because they believe that their own
        actions matter.
        - this descends from the belief that their world is defined
          from what they make it, instead of being defined by a
          restricted set of convergent paths leading toward potential
          futures.
  - there is social flux and churn to this "sociometaphysical"
    phenomenon. every region, group of people and individual is unique
    in how they view the world. there is always change to how people
    see the world and in the types of lenses through which they know
    to see the world
    - this social flux/churn was seen in the 20th century, from the
      buildup to WW2 and throughout the Cold War. Marxist ideology
      needs [people to believe in] the materialistic conception to
      disrupt old ideologies and to cause the potential for a
      "universal" worldview to emerge: on ostensibly based on science.
      - Communists promise a utopia free of economics where a dominant
        worldview based only on rationalism and science stamps
        everything out.
      - in practice, the worldview that the Party promotes is poisoned
        by Marxism's own flaws, its need to rewrite history, its need
        to use STEM as mechanisms of control, and its need to control
        "truth" to advance its agenda.
    - this social flux/churn also resulted from the explosion of
      rationalism and science: people who understand the world through
      the lens of science are usually in the materialistic camp.
      - people have been arguing about this for millenia, but (science
        drove this viewpoint forward)

  - this "sociometaphysical" flux/churn results in expansions and
    contractions in the sociophysical possibility space, as it appears
    to individuals of all classes and creeds.
    - how you view the world defines how you see the range of options
      for action in the world.
    - when everyone believes the (same thing), this enables people in
      power. when people's belief systems are unpredictable and
      typologically incoherent, this results in informational spectral
      discord:
      - power structures are likely to change,
      - people in power make mistakes as previously held assumptions
        no longer hold true
      - but most critically: people are much less predictable


- the social/individual components of an individual's
  belief/knowledge/information system
  - religion is a social belief system, but it is acquired gradually

- what is the knowledge of good and evil?
  - one personal interpretation of this
  - the knowledge of the knowledge of good and evil
    - understanding this is fairly advanced knowledge of power

- is it right do to right? is it wrong to do wrong?
  - is it wrong to stand for what is right?
  - is it right to stand for what is wrong?

  - would you encourage others to think that it is right to do what is
    wrong?
  - would you encourage others to think that is is wrong to do what is
    right? and what if you encourage them to believe that what is
    right is wrong?
  - (word this so that it is less confusing)
- there are higher-order aspects at play to determine morality,
  especially when you assume that words and actions can shape
  someone's belief system to define or redefine both right and wrong.
  - any actions or words can be perceived along a moral triumvarate(?)
    of (encouraging), (discouraging), and null (reword this?)
    - include a fourth category (incognizant or unknowing)
    - that is, where does your response to someone's words/actions
      fall along this triumvirate spectrum: do you encourage their
      actions, discourage them or do you present a null response?
  - do you encourage actions you believe to be moral? do you encourage
    actions you believe to be immoral?
    - far more important are the higher-order aspects to this:
      - do you encouarage actions that encourage moral actions?
      - do you discourage actions that discourage immoral actions?
      - do you discourage actions that encourage moral actions?
      - do you encourage actions that discourage immoral actions?
    - the wrong answers to the questions above allow you to *appear*
      moral, but encouarge immoral behavior of 1&deg; and 2&deg;
      connections.
      - you can appear moral while encouraging/using negative
        behavior. this is a tool of karmic obfuscation. this is yet
        another reason why intent is so important. Do you intend for
        negativity and malice to spew from your heart through the
        actions of another? Because if you are skilled, you can do so,
        while appearing like a saint.
      - intent is critical, especially if you are wise and skilled
        enough to judge or even measure the downstream consequences of
        your actions. even the most skilled person may create problems
        through the most well-intended actions and reactions.
        - but if you intend harm, we can be sure that you will create
          harm. it is much more challenging to do good than it is to
          do evil. but are the actions of the good man well-rewarded?
          by who? by himself? by society? by law? why then, would man
          do good and profit not, when he could do ill and society
          rewards him? if naivety and wishful thinking are all that
          keeps a society's evil in check, that society won't have the
          teeth to restrain lust for power, greed or malice for long.

- It terrifies me to think of an Earth with a few billion less
  people. The remnants of such a planet are filled with the
  archetypical terror of a neodeluvian calamity and pitted against
  their own fearful nihilism, who must live practically in a world
  devoid of both virtue and moral indemnity.
  - the soil of that world, does it allow anything to grow? does it
    nurture anything? If any incentivization for virtue and morality
    have been annihilated by practical concerns for survival, where
    does that leave the notions of family and community? That world is
    incredibly dark and nothing of value grows there.

![Pole Reversal](/img/)


- The intricate dynamics of a geomagnetic pole reversal parallel the
  implications to moral systems as belief systems are disrupted
  geosocially.
  - The epistemic distruption causes people to reshape the information
    and knowledge that constitutes their belief systems. Individually
    and collectively, belief systems form the basis of moral
    systems. (Geosocially), these belief systems have spectral effects
    with constructive and destructive resonance.
    - is "geosocial" the right term here? or sociophysical? with the
      internet, the physical matters less
  - the point: this disruption of moral systems leads to chaos, but
    presents opportunities for people to harness that chaos as a kind
    of dynamo for revolution: of knowledge systems, political systems
    and (to reshape the integration of social institutions as they
    connect with society)
  - connecting this to a "pole-reversal" reduces it to good vs. evil
    and is too binary. how to connected this to nietzschean ideas of
    "beyond good and evil" -- this is really *applied Nietzsche*.
  - while this pole-reversal happening, most people great and small
    are so distracted by the lower-order effects that they don't
    bother looking for the root of the problems emerging in society
    - this presents an opportunity for those who are proactively
      driving this socioepistemic chaos to leverage it for
      sociopolitical gain or to sow the seeds of conflict.
    - regardless, this is how revolutions and wars begin. this is how
      the untouchably powerful are (challenged), deconstructed and
      dismantled. it's not simple. if it was simple, the untouchably
      powerful would simply defuse it.
  - while this chaos plays out, the political and economic elite
    remain enamored with illusions that it is they who run the state
    or economic order. they become ex

- I'm not trying to argue that this is a good idea. I'm trying to
  point out that this is very much what is happening in American and
  Western societies immediately. People need to wake up. Our societies
  are fragile, not robust. What is happening is extremely
  sophisticated. These social and informational dynamics are being
  proactively driven so that western powers reactively waste their
  sociophysical and financial resources chasing all these fires, which
  are ultimately insignificant when compared to the higher-order root
  causes of the dynamics.
  - as long as the intellectual elite dictates that the root causes of
    these tumultuous socioepistemic dynamics remain verboten and
    off-limits for discussion, then neither the elite nor the poor in
    these countries will be able to assess, diagnose or treat the
    problems to any (significant) effect.
  - it's because we now consider it immoral to even discuss the true
    root causes of many of these problems. or at least, it's trivial
    for the adversarial liberal elite to reframe their opponents'
    rhetoric, so that it becomes rebranded as politically incorrect.
    - as long as no one is permitted to discuss the root causes, we'll
      be wasting our time pissing away all our sociophysical and
      financial potential energies. We'll squander every resource we
      have and gain nothing for it.
    - there are some subjects and rhetorical propositions in modern
      western society branded politcally incorrect which are verboten
      and should continue to be deemed immoral.
    - it is incredibly unproductive and disempowering when (certain)
      speech is branded as politically incorrect or inherently immoral
      -- simply so that liberals win the argument for the day.
    - They threaten to deprive conservatives and political adversaries
      of sociohierarchical territory and social influence by stifling
      all debate on critical issues. They systematically undermine
      moral systems and belief systems which occupy (critical) roles
      in society, without ever thinking about ensuring those roles are
      provided for by institutions or belief systems in society.
    - They want to save the world and save the people, but are
      completely detached from reality when it comes to understanding
      the higher-order effects of their actions and policy. They want
      to save society, but they don't understand social behavior
      whatsoever. Except, apparently, insofar as how social aspects of
      society can be utilized to detain, block and disempower their
      political rivals.

Why is "Pindar" their leader? Because Pindar's vision and authenticity
is unparalleled. They are constantly looking for the person that has
what they do not. Pindar is not a single person, per se. Pindar only
derives his authority from his resistance to their flame, but they do
not know who Pindar is because they are looking for the person who can
see what they do not. And the Illuminati have meticulously crafted
mechanisms for ensuring the properly networked architecture of
society, all decentralized and autonomous. It is outlined similarly to

So, they cannot recognize Pindar, but because they seek to so tightly
control the prevaling narratives, myths and especially history, they
hate this person. He is the blinding one who tells stories they cannot
understand and writes truths which cannot so easily be perceived.
Those stories slip through their minds' grasp; he is the one who slips
through their cracks, all the while blinding everyone around him. They
hate him, but they need him because he can see what they cannot -- yet
a person like this can never be given power in their understanding of

<a name="heresy-for-heirophants" />

### [Heresy for Heirophants](#heresy-for-heirophants)

Black Magick is pure darkness. The antidote is religion and
virtue. Whether black or not, magick is not pure evil in and of
itself. It is a tool and one that magnifies the intent of the groups
using it. If their intent is evil, it magnifies evil. However, black
magick in particular can do an ungodly amount of harm because of the
darkness it requires: it tends to create large effects while
circumventing potential restraints that wiser people might have placed
on it if they were only aware. Instead the miasma foments itself,
while the karmic storm is building, no one knows to stop it until it's
too late. There is always a better way.

That said, if you don't want to get burnt, don't go chasing
dragons. Those who never want anything greater than they can
comtemplate building with the tools in front of them never go looking
for things like this and end up happier because of it. Those who learn
about magick too early tend to use it unwisely because they neither
know enough about the general consequences of life to understand the
effects of their actions, nor do they even know what they want from
life. Instead, by acting too early and too immaturely, they end up
precluding the cultivation of greater possibilities later on in their
lives. If they had instead waited, they would know what they truly
wanted and they'd know better how to create it.



If the Illuminati's bread and butter is controlling your mind by
limiting the prevelance of ideas and control, then the Black Sabbath
in its various forms is essentially Illuminati caviar. What do little
baby Illuminati fish eggs taste like? They don't exactly talk about
it, but I've heard they taste something like a cross between peeps and
free-range Cadbury creme eggs.

This "Black Sabbath" is no different than feeding babies to Moloch.
Yes, the very same Moloch in the Allen Ginsburg poem, Howl. The
Babylonians seem to have excelled so much at this that everyone still
half-assedly worships their bull-god, Moloch, who is a staple guest at
every baby-sacrificing event. Purely metaphor, of course...

This is all an ad hoc decentralized dark ritual where sociophysical
potential energy is harvested through people's ignorance, their
obedience, their constraint by sin and their will to use others for
their gain. Then, the naked truth of these horrors serves to shock the
world into rationalization or suppression of that truth.


- [Saul and the Witch of Endor](www.mechon-mamre.org/p/pt/pt08a28.htm#3)


Why is it so hard to remember? If this really happens, how can we ever
forget?! The transgenerational components are critical to this
ritualized power magnification: by the time Anti-Santa Moloch's coming
to town again to eat your babies like a drunk Krampus on fire,
everyone seems to have forgotten about the last time Moloch came to
town. No, sadly, Rudolph ... doesn't make it.

Why do these dark, Ouroborosian rituals persist from culture to
culture? The tragic, heart-wrenching truth is that these processes do
generate power via systematic karmic obfuscation. As starkly as it
contrasts my sardonic humor above, I literally want to burst into
tears writing this. It is evil so dark, you hope that your children
and their children never learn about it, even if their own lives are
torn apart to be fed to this Beast that re-emerges whenever power
magnifies itself.

##

You want the truth? The truth is that the world is a (dark) place,
where good people are willing to engage in evil acts, or at least look
the other way, considering these evil acts to be the price paid to
defend whatever it is they consider to be good. They don't have any
better ideas for their enemies other than to alchemically harvest them
for their sociophysical energy.

These secrets, which may sound like fantasy, you can never unsee
them. If they know that you know, they will hunt you down, tear your
family apart or use you as a scapegoat, an alchemical catalyst,
perhaps the worst of all. For the fantastical delusions of a rambling
lunatic unpublished author, these assholes sure have been willing to
tear my life to pieces. There is no single organized order or secret
society; these groups have been emerging and shifting shape since
before the pyramids or stonehenge. No order has preserved itself for
more than a few centuries and there are always hundreds of them
operating. These groups of shadowy people emerge from the lust for
power and once they commit themselves to evil, they fight ruthlessly
to hide their acts from the world.

- worth your salt

These kinds of higher-order rituals metamorphisize from form to form
in various societies. These groups prefer to operate from the shadows
because, no matter how strong or malevalent, evil falls to pieces in
the light. Most people are inherently good and want to stand for good;
they cannot sit by and stand for the self-enrichment of a few at the
cost of the many. Therefore, these mechaniations require darkness and
deceipt. Some of these groups work towards good or some higher goal.
Others exist simply to feed their own desires by using these
techniques to realize their fantasies. Almost none of them would
respond to or understand the metaphor of the "Black Sabbath" described
herein as I understand it.

Many civilizations were notorious in the way they used people. For
example, the early Assyrians were renowned in their cruelty. Why were
the early Assyrians so cruel? I believe it is because they emerged
after a millenia of mesopotamian conflict. The Assyrians learned their
cruelty from that of the earlier Sumerian and Akkadian Empires, but
they had not yet learned why you restrain such cruelty. That was how
they understood power: by learning from the multigenerational
experience of being controlled through cruelty from the Sumerians in
the southeast and the Akkadians in the Northwest. The Assyrians
imitated what appeared to be successful tactics of these empires,
believing those would contribute to their empire's strength, expanse
and self-preservation. The Assyrians may have then intentionally bred
these values into their culture via social engineering. If so, they
did not understand how to restrain humanity's capacity for evil.

During the third millenia BCE, power centres in the area shifted every
few centuries, from the the southeastern union of the Tigris and
Euphrates to Anatolia, the northwestern source of those rivers; there
was a consant ebb and flow of power and dominance over commerce
between those in the eastern and western economic apogees of
Mesopotamia. This resulted in a millenia of geopolitical struggle over
Old World's center of commerce and the tax revenues therein. Struggles
like these led to the development of the knowledge of leadership and
power, for better and for worse. This eventually gives us the
Babylonian deity Moloch, it's mythos and all the knowledge encoded
therein.

Language is a program that defines a network operating system of

ideas can be invoked in others towards (both creating and leveraging)
the convergence of abstractions across the minds of individuals. Our

### [The Difference Between Man and Animal is Primarily Noological](#the-difference-between-man-and-animal-is-primarily-noological)

The primary distinction between man and animal is that we attempt to
reach consensus of abstractions through language: this means that I
try to learn about your mental abstractions; you try to learn about my
mental abstractions; humanity tries to reach consensus of mental
abstractions. Animals also do this, but can only communicate through
universal semiotics, via body language or some other means, so for
them, abstractions converge more slowly and almost never reach
consensus. Language is the *human* mechanism that separates us from
animals: we distinguished ourselves as human by deciding amoung
ourselves to name all the animals and to name all the
abstractions. Thus, our humanity was never much of a biological
distinction, but instead a noological one: animals simply lacked
genetically consistent means of abstraction consensus and thus never
hit the critical mass for neurogenetic epigenetic evolution.

### The "Illuminati's" Leverage of Linguisitic Duplicity Means Their Codes Have Always Been Decipherable Algorithmically

- Their codes were designed to remanifest and redistribute their
  protocols and decentralized logistic structures in the future, ad
  hoc upon the academic elite learning enough language and utilizing
  enough writing.
  - and the mythos of cultures is like a compendium of programs that
    leverage a specific langauge as an operating system.

- this was always going to happen
  - regardless of which secret society you consider, they all leverage
    morphemic duplicity to hide codes
  - there are many means of encoding information into text, speech,
    literature and language
    - almost none of these are sufficiently hard to be algorithmically
      secure.
    - one of the things i mentioned to Tatiana was the potential to
      algorithmically resolve ALL of the codes leveraged in

- almost all these codes are mostly insecure, which is why these
  groups intentionally spread them around so the multiplicity obscures
  their origin, enabling plausible deniability
- almost all the methods behind these codes are rankable in hardness.
  - it is preordained by the existance of the Singularity and the
    nature of unrestrained computation that these codes can and will
    be resolved in every sufficiently advanced society
    - around ... welll right the fuck now.

- connect these to (?)

- another reason why the argument over material origination of ideas
  and ideal origination of ideas is so important.
  - if ideas originate materially, this means that if the originator
    discloses them to someone, they can force that person to adhere to
    specific obligations, formally or even contractually. this is like
    what you sign your soul over for.
  - however, if ideas originate or congeal to the immaterial, it means
    that anyone can be the originator of either some or all ideas on
    their own by the force of sheer thought.
    - that is, your mind can find reach any idea if it is simply
      intelligent enough, which is a fantastic reason for these
      "illuminated ones" to identify intelligence early, so they can
      spoonfeed you simple information you would otherwise identify
      yourself, but bind your soul contractually for the rest of your
      life.
  - the truth is that all ideas at least cohere to or map to ideas
    that first originate from the ideal. otherwise, if this were not
    so, one could not reasonably make assumptions about other
    sufficiently advanced civilizations because every civilization
    would have its own specific divergent development. this is simply
    not true.
    - enthalpy is what causes the physical instantiations of
      materially metaphysical information to bind to and cohere to
      information which is purely immaterial -- it is timeless and
      spaceless.
      - in spite of the random, chaotic diffusion of high entropy,
        enthalpy encourages information to cohere to the immaterial,
        against all apparent odds.
      - if this were not the case, one could not expect the folding
        funnel hypothesis to hold up.

    language pairs, language triples, etc
  - these untranslatables provide a metric for semantic parity b/w
    languages.
    - (1) languages descending form common roots diverge further over
      time.
      - this causes them to accrue generally more
        "untranslatables". furthermore, there are energy/entropy
        dynamics at play governing large-scale evolution of
        morpheme-to-sememe mappings and semantic networks
      - that is, evolution of morphemes-to-sememes over time causes
        sememes and morphemes to "repel" each other in semantic space
        - ...
    - (2) langauges experiencing coevolutionary dynamics by being

      - these langauges usually share common language roots, but not
        always.
      - for languages occupying regions that are close, new concepts
        are introduced at similar times via trade and political
        influences. new ideas are introduced, but the speakers of each
        language must unconsciously decide how to map new morphemes to
        new ideas.
  - for both of these types of sufficiently similar languages, they
    have similar semantic networks than "less similar" languages.
    - and particularly, their evolutionary dynamics over decades of
      time should exhibit more similarity than other less similar
      languages.
    - however, measuring these languages requires vast volumes of
      literature whose authorship can't be too centralized and can't
      be too decentralized. this is a common problem with data in
      computational linguistics: there aren't very many languages with
      enough data to measure semantic networks or evolutionary
      dynamics with confidence.
      - the period of european literature from c. 1500-1900 is ideal

  - for both of these cases, "semantic triangulation" of
    untranslatabes provides a semantic signature that should be
    characteristically preserved *or* deformed over time in ways that
    are idiosyncratic when compared to "more translatable" words.
    - identifying these untranslatables among language tuples and
      processing them with computational lingustic techniques into
      digitized data for semantic analysis enables their idiosyncratic
      semantic translation signatures to be used as the semantic
      equivalent of how any position in the universe can be determined
      by comparing the stars in the sky to a map of known pulsars
    - pulsars are incredibly rare stars with idiosyncratic qualities
      that very along their plane of rotation. the set of visible
      pulsars allows you to resolve your position in the physical
      universe very quickly by determining how frequently the visible
      pulsars are rotating and along which plane they rotate.
      - every other star looks fairly similar, but pulsars are so rare
        and idiosyncratic that the likelyhood that there are two
        points in the universe that share a similar view of pulsars is
        beyond infinitesimal.
    - how do maps of pulsars as used for the ascertainment of position
      in the universe relate to the concept of [orthonormal
      basis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orthonormal_basis)
      - what kind of "basis" enables this resolution?
  - these idiosyncratic "untranslatables" function similarly to
    pulsars in navigating semantic networks, the convolution of which
    should lead us to becoming capable of mapping the metaphysical.
    - there are almost certainly problems of intractibility related to
      this process of epistemic convolution towards a map/basis for a
      universal semantic network
    - however, this universal semantic network probably corresponds to
      mathematic structures and would provide the optimal basis for
      Leipniz's [Characteristica
      Universalis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Characteristica_universalis)
      - connect to [Kleene
        Star](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kleene_star)
        - how does the concept of kleene star connect combinatorics
          and language?

  - how are such "Untranslatable" signatures useful for NLP or
    computational linguistics?
    - (1) this construct provides another tool to assess the parity of
      translations. that this works for humans is apparent in the
      "Dictionary of Untranslatables" where the authors discuss common
      traps of translation and common concepts/words to identify to
      quickly gauge the translator's sentiment/antipathy towards the
      work they're translating, even if the concept at hand is
      seemingly minor.
      - example of a common trap: translations of the concept of
        agency b/w french/english works of philosophy. it is
        difficult/confusing to translate. understanding how the
        translator chooses to handle sujet & agency in works that
        cover those topics have implications for the parity of the
        translation.
        - the french/english translation problem for agent & agency is
          also a great example of a translation that has grammatical
          implications and, as such, is a particular difficult problem
          that must be overcome in NLP and computational linguistic
          analysis. so, in particular situations, there are no
          satisfactory "substitutions" for agent/sujet
    - (2) observing the distance between morphemes and their
      idiosyncratic sememes over time to quantify dynamics in
      linguistic evolution
      - these idiosyncratic untranslatable sememes then become a kind
        of "standard candle". the complex distance between these
        standard candles over time is very important.
      - however, more critical to the study of dynamics in linguistic
        evolution is observing how this distance from *other* concepts
        (sememes and morphemes) as they relate to the semantic
        "standard candles"
        - especially if it's possible to begin measure entropy and
          distribution of sememes in semantic networks and the
          morphemic pointers mapped to them in particular languages.
        - because (energy dynamics) apply (in complicated perhaps
          unquantifyable fashion) to semantic networks
          - for regions of semantic networks where there are too many
            morphemes mapping to sememes, those morphemes will
            gradually repel each other.
          - however, morphemes don't simply map to singular
            sememes. they map in complicated fashion. and occasionaly,
            very artificial dynamics begin to emerge based on
            psycholingustic implications of the phonology of morphemes
            as the relates to other morphemes (e.g. puns and homonyms)
          - whenever these artificial dynamics occur, they defy the
            common energetic dynamics that govern natural evolution of
            semantic networks.
        - this is where you begin to see the "invisible hand" of the
          illuminati's control over langauge and linguistic
          evolution. eventually, it will be demonstrated in an
          undeniable manner by computational linguistics.

Apparently überpowerful people -- -- have an unnatural phobia of
illicit philosophy. More than anything else, they are scared of people
who think in new and different ways because peoples who are different
can't be predicted. Thus, sociologically constrain the typology &
metatypological aspects of psychology -- perhaps by introducing
artificial belief systems, however contemptuously you may hold them --
and people become like special dolls with meta/types imbued onto them
via Alchemy, like Manakin Skywalker right here.

#### Manakin Skywalker Does Airflares

![Manakin Skywalker Does Airflares](/img/posts/2018-01-22-semioteleological-revolution/manakin-skywalker.jpg)

What does this imply for the computability of past, current and future
past social physics, in a future with unrestrained quantum computing?
If the myriad psychosocial meta/typology of sociophysical entities is
profoundly more expansive, doesn't that make it harder to predict and
control people? What does that mean in the future? Considered from
this basis alone -- *future sociophysical computation* -- it is
fascinating to think about the phenomenological consequences: is it
good or bad for people to be unique?

### The Perfect Ingredients For Creating The Perfect Ruler, Both Light And Dark

![Just Dark Ruler](/img/posts/2018-01-22-semioteleological-revolution/ruler-dark-and-light.jpg)

There's hardly anything unique about this process of the evokation of
the combination of meta/typological psychosocial fragments within a
person. This process has been reinstantiated, reiterated &
recombinated through the ages.

- TODO: describe more about bringing the perfect ingredients together
  for creating the perfect psychologies for particular roles in
  society
  - kind of like nietzsche's philosophy, applied to imbuing the
    (tabala-rasa like raw materials) towards creating the perfect
    psychologies for filling roles in social hierarchies
    - ideal psychosocial dynamics for generally pushing people towards
      a nietzschean thirst for power over their circumstances and
      power over their own struggle
      - the ideal psychology for society is never a uniform psychology
    - filling roles in social hierarchies
      - (a la "the presidential model")


- Is your mind strong? Can the spirit within you be quelled that
  drives you to fight in times of war and build in times of peace? Is
  it easier to placate people in times of peace, social conflict or
  war? In times of peace and prosperity or conflict and war, what
  tools and weapons do people make available to themselves? Necessity
  is the mother of invention, but when prosperity takes away our need
  to overcome struggle, doesn't that sow the seeds of
  intergenerational decay?
  - perhaps move this paragraph to a later section on imbuing the
    ideal Nietzschean psychological metatypes for the constant
    struggle forward, despite the apparent need to overcome struggle


- This came as a response to watching the second episode of Dies Irae,
  but I thought the idea was terrible, so I guess I threw away the
  post-it note. now I'm pissed off and less willing to compromise by
  throwing away ideas that might be considered ... bad
  - people are born thinking they are Tabula Rasa, but they are imbued
    with psychological meta/types that shape them into who they are.
  - how does this relate to extrapolating Nietzsche's philosophy into
    social engineering? creating a world without conflict makes people
    weak. a world with constant conflict, so long as that conflict is
    not destabalizing, forces people to struggle with each other.
    - in the end, this affects some people negatively, but on the
      whole, the society is stronger. the people are psychologically
      stronger and more resilient.
      - without this process, the society as a whole stops
        adapting. struggle leads to adaptation and social darwinisim
        produces a stronger society. when the society is insulated
        against threats and, thus, unaware of the source of
        power/prosperity that leads to its insulated (shangri-la),
        then people can become weak. they can select rules/norms that
        stifle internal conflict, but in the long term, this produces
        a next generation which is completely unable to cope with the
        world outside that (shangri-la). it is thus unable to
        perpetuate it's prosperity and the source if it's power begins
        to dwindle.
    - connect this to the extrapolation of nietzsche's philosophy
      - does it connect to Schopenhauer? did the philosophy of
        heideggar and others "fill in" these extrapolations?
      - did it connect moreso to the idea of the evoluation into the
        ubermensche? isn't this idea of moderate artificial conflict

- "Those who fall into the web will be tested" - provocation of
  artificial conflict, similar to baptism by fire, to test the worth,
  merit or specific utility of individuals -- or to push them out
  altogether if they prove useless or risky
  - only those who are strong enough will remain close to the center,
    which ensures that the center is composed of a high density of
    strong people. if the children or 1&deg; connections of those
    close to the center are not strong enough, they will be pushed out
    or tested through conflict.
  - aqua regia (the acid test) -- if it's not gold, then strong nitric
    acid will melt it away instantly. if there exists a high density
    of true value, then testing through competition should reveal
    that.
    - provocation of transcendence of limitation
      - "what doesn't kill you makes you stronger" if you aren't so
      weak to give in or "die."
    - fear and love as tools for provoking innate (ability) to
      transcend limitation/restraint/obstacles.

### Lack of Tort Reform Typologically Constrains Life Experience of Americans

- this section needs to be communicated as demonstrating mechanisms in
  society that contributed systemically (to creating psychologically
  weaker people)
  - i.e. not in line with the above Nietzschean machine for creating
    stronger people generally and the strongest people

- it turns our education system into something that shelters us and
  protects us from all the things we need to experinece in small
  amounts in youth -- because we might get hurt.
  - we need to experience these struggles in the right way and early
    on, so that we learn to stand up to them
  - they must be experienced in the right way, otherwise they can be
    damaging.

- what is the primary cause of this problem? economic incentives for
  the kind of lawyers that chase ambulances and suck the blood out of
  parents they've terrified into protecting their children.  They also
  suck the blood right out of the (sued) social institutions that must
  then adapt to that one individual's legal circumstances, which were
  inflated wildly out of proportion primarily by
  - unfortunately this is an attractive vehicle for social change,
    compelled by lawsuit. once precendent is set and other similar
    social institutions see the sky-high legal costs, they immediately
    adapt. this provokes logically-oriented social change, across most
    of the rest of the gameboard.
  - by presenting itself as an attractive, effective means of
    provoking system-wide social change, it's also an appealing
    vehicle for subversion. the results of these sky-high legal
    settlements appeal to the financial interests of corporate
    fatcats, while occasionally making all Americans weaker as a
    result.
    - some of those exorbitant settlement penalties are necessary for
      justice. more often than not, the price tag on that is some
      lawyers trying to milk the situation they identified as being
      one that produces such a sky-high penalty: and they get 20% of
      however high they can push that number. take into account the
      uncertainty of collecting on debt owed as a settlement by a
      business now forced to close their doors permanently and a
      blood-sucking lawyer will put financial interests over the
      pursuit of justice every single time. it's their job.

  - money is the root of all evil. you'll find that most everything in
    society is a facade layered on top of underlying structures of
    economic incentivization. when you make dramatic changes to those
    structures, what in amazement as everything else magically
    congeals itself around the new structures of incentivization. if
    you can just compel money to move in well-justified ways or along
    channels that push financial energy out to a middle class, you'll
    be surprised at how quickly some of these changes occur.
    - however, the rich and powerful know this, so when you approach
      those underlying structures, you'll probably be attacked and
      anything you put in that idea box will be sent directly to the
      incinerator.

- neglecting the need for tort reform is destroying this country.
  there are so many options which are implicitly inviolated by fears &
  anxieties over potential legal liability.
  - in addition to providing much needed justice at times, abusing the
    civil law system is a means for weak people to abuse legal methods
    to sieze the wealth of rich people. the legal system facilitates
    class warfare, while making all americans weaker as a result.
  - we can't have anything in society that risks harming anyone
    because someone will get sued over it. this is why we can't have
    nice things; nice, exciting things that teach us valuable lessons
    in life.
    - but the result is that, collectively, our individual life
      experiences become typologically constrained, so we do not adapt
      to these experiences. Then, when we encounter them later in life
      without adequate preparation, we're completely caught offguard
      and naively approach the situation as novices. sheltering
      everyone in this way ends up buttering people up to be abused
      later in life, to be vulnerable, to be unable to reap the
      benefits of engaging in activities with mild degrees of risk.

#### K-OS The Love Song

- also, for some means of educating Americans, the potential is
  completely inviolated because of legal complexities
  - e.g. martial arts can't be taught in schools. martial arts is a
    great example because of (its neuological impacts on the mind)
  - activities like these, and driving the right kinds of competition
    promote healthy psychological development.
    - from a neurological perspective, some games, skills and hobbies
      facilitate the development of the mind, but this is most
      effective in youth.
    - link to epistemology-cat-theory-part-3
  - when we engage in these activities and master them in youth, we
    develop our minds to be prepared for STEM work.

###

- i really need to settle on a consistent set of terms for describing
  the parts of this "nietzschean" system
  - for creating a bridge to the ubermensche
    - (an asymptotic goal which cannot be obtained)

- how does the Nietzschean (system) counter external threats that seek
  to socioepistemologically undermine the evolutionary mechanisms
  which produce stronger people?
  - the competition for these systems can easily highlight those who
    could not withstand the evolutionary mechanisms of the society.
    - if the value of those mechanisms cannot be conveyed to the
      (average person), external systems will find it easy to lead
      astray those on the outskirts of society.
      - external systems can use those people by artificially
        empowering them, making them feel like they've been victimized
        by the evolutionary mechanisms society
  - people everywhere are generally equally strong and smart as
    everyone else. why do differences emerge in how nations cooperate
    and in how cultures seem to differ? these differences primarily
    emerge in how people chose to accumulate, store, divert and exert
    their sociophysical potential energe.
    - At scale, the belief systems of individuals cause major
      differences to emerge in how people choose to cooperate and
      compete. in other words, the belief systems distributed through
      the minds of men act as metaphysical channels for the diversion,
      influence and confluence of will transformed into action. one
      accrues sociophysical potential energy by working throughout
      life; one transmutes this potential energy into kinetic
      sociophysical through will, while choosing to direct it where
      thou wilt by thy mind.
      - seen from the materialist's limited conception of the
        metaphysical, their understanding of how one can
        systematically channel the will of groups of individuals
        socially is limited. why? because all individuals are unique
        to them and incomparable, therefore all sociophysical
        extrapolations are intractably divergent. As long as you
        socially forbid certain philosophical methods of thought --
        those dependent on the idealistic, Hegelian notions of the
        metaphysical -- then your inferior materialistic conceptions
        of the metaphysical appear to ring true. This is fine: the
        power of the idealistic metaphysical does not depend on
        whether people believe it is true, whereas the power of the
        materilistic conceptions of metaphysics does.

    - We all have fundamentally the same hardware, genetically. Though
      there are *some* epigenetic differences, it is best to believe
      we are all the same, in spite of any differences, which are
      almost completely superficial. These differences can be
      superseded and obliterated by the life experience: believing in
      some preexisting or predominant limitations of race is truly
      ignorant and denies the credit due to the individuals'
      experiences in shaping their lives, minds and strengths. we are
      the sum of our thought, the sum of our experience and the sum
      our will to shatter what holds us back in life. we should all
      seek to empower each other, to relieve one another of the
      burdens which hold us back.

  a lie, and a lie that is ostensibly constructed specifically or
  generally for their own detriment.

    like communism, which must extinguish all other knowledge systems

      this is Yaldaboath, the ignorant god-like being from Gnosticism

#### Dali - Leda Atomica (1949)

![Dali - Leda Atomica](/img/posts/2018-01-22-semioteleological-revolution/dali-leda-atomica.jpg)

  - if you dupe your enemy into creating a reality that is false and
    you hold the keys to demonstrate that their strongly constructed
    reality is false, you have power to live within smaller lies of
    your own, so long as you can anticipate that your enemy will
    continue to lie
    - (ostensibly), your enemy had left you with no choice because
      the truth would have gotten you killed, or at least allowed your
      enemy to react so that it would perpetuate the greater lie
  - history is a collection of myths distinguished from traditional
    and religious mythos by being "true" for some definition of
    true. however, the truth is, the mythos of history is a carefully
    controlled series of events, large and small, that are more often
    architected to unfold to operate as a pattern of events that the
    future will look back on to both construct its consensus reality
    and for people to understand their place in the world. therefore,
    controlling the details of events so that they unfold to tell the
    story most preferable to you is one of the most powerful
    techniques for preserving power.
    - the illuminati will never let someone who is a "ghost"
      participate in the events of history. they will never, ever be
      permitted to be part of society in a large way *because* those
      inconvenient details of their life can't be allowed to multiply
      - every major figure in history is placed under a microscope for
        future generations to study. if you're a major figure in
        history or a thought leader or a revolutionary CEO, people
        will look into your life and your story: even the most
        seemingly minor details. the world can't be allowed to
        publicly acknowledge that something like the illuminati exists
        because it would mean that everything "under the rug" so to
        speak becomes visible. powerful people sweep things under the
        rug all the time and they seek to keep secret all the types of
        methods used to sweep things under the rug.
      - therefore, having these methods used on you makes you
        ineligible to participate in (any great aspects of history)
        unless you agree to swallow that blue pill and pray that you
        don't get rubbed out for the potential risk you pose to
        powerful people if you don't or can't help them keep all their
        shit under that rug.
      - IMO, that's bullshit.

  - TLDR: if you write anything that threatens these shadowy "powers
    that be" in any significant way, they will consider any success or
    attention as a potential threat and will never allow you to
    transcend their restraints, until you ruthlessly destroy any such
    sociophysical restraints they attempt to place on you.
    - because it is details in your story or in your writing that
      threatens them, they will never allow you to transcend such
      sociophysical isolation. not without a pen-name. they don't want
      people looking at anything you've ever done.
    - the degree of threat your story poses is proportionaly to the
      degree of damage you will need to do to the people they try to
      send against you until they learn their lesson.
    - these people will deceive you in any way they can and dupe you
      in any way they can. trust nothing, except your instincts and
      what you can know to be fact. learn to follow what they fear and
      ruthlessly destroy them with it, unless you enjoy spending the
      rest of your life inside an invisible cage as nothing but an
      expendable pawn.
      - that said, play your hand slowly, one card at a
        time. Gradually turn up the heat, until you can ensure they
        fear not knowing the cards you have left in your hand. cover
        your ass and don't run out of cards. it's not a game you want
        to play, nor is it a game that anyone can actually win. the
        only victory for me at this point is necessarily Pyrrhic. They
        will blame you for everything you destroy.
      - Because the objectives of keeping me in a sociophysical prison
        cell require the minimization of all information associated to
        me, I have to be the bull in a china shop that destroys ever
        piece of china in order for anyone to ever care to acknowledge
        anything I do. It's too easy and too inline with their goals
        to placate me with gaslighting. All I know is that no one else
        has ever had a chance to fight like I have and I do not plan
        on ever letting these Illuminati assholes off the hook without
        a sociological complex that forces them to think carefully
        about ever doing this to someone like me again. I will
        metaphorically destroy everything around me so that I can
        reshape our collective reality and history into an
        informational weapon that humanity can use to keep these
        sadistic creeps in line for a thousand years or more.
        - pic: doctor strange, making any weapon he needs

- fluidity of Nietzsche's proposed transvaluation of all values
  [systems] (although i need to refresh my memory here)
  - was Nietzsche trying to establish this "transvaluation of all
    values" as the basis of a ideal values system? or just as a means
    for comparing values systems?
    - either way, it does form the basis of potentially amoral values
      systems, especially if your goal is the pursuit of
      power. basically, this idea of "transvaluation" is the the
      pinnacle of values systems abstractions or genericizations.
      - and insomuch, it allows you to "wrap" any existing values
        systems. you can undermine them, if you so choose, or play
        them aganst each other.
      - this is similar to what Nietzsche meant as "beyond good and
        evil" => every values system, regardless of how prevalent, has

        values systems are different from each other.
        - the ideal of transvaluation is really like combinatorial
          category theory, wrapping values systems in combinatorial
          monadic structure, so that one can be defined in terms of
          another or so that one can be transformed into another.
        - therefore, you can use many of Nietzsche ideas to undermine
          existing social orders if that is your goal. more wisely,
          you can most efficiently understand how to work with
          existing social orders and moral systems so that the best
          outcome can be achieved. to do so, you have to detach
          yourself from their specific values systems, but this does
          not mean that you seek to undermine them or play them
          against each other.

Überpowerful people generally cannot stand someone who encourages
people to think in unpredictable ways. This vastly expands the
sociophysical gamespace. They already have control. Why do they need
you? They rather wait it out and play it safe. You cannot be permitted
to enjoy success, fame or even a modicum of attention why you're
working with such magickal witchcraft as *novel ideas*. Those are
dangerous. Instead these elite would much rather watch as you quietly
flail in agony, so they can completely control the destiny of your
image after you die, sucking you dry while you live with no one around
to help you. This allows them to maintain control of your ideas,
preventing them from spreading,giving the überelite the time and space
they desparately need to react strategically to unprecented GENIUS.
This is why every living successful artist is probably a fraud and
every wildly successful artist has been dead for a generation before
anyone ever "discovered" him.

When do they need someone who pushes the envelope and expands the
sociophysical gamespace? When they're losing and don't know it.

neither can be discerned without misinterpreting the other, no person

humanity. Thus, we are becoming completely disconnected from the myths
which helped inculcate the values systems via teleology. This will be
disastrous because we understand the world through symbology encoded
into language and myth. When that semioteleology is sufficiently
disrupted without anything to replace it, people don't relate to the
world, nor can they relate to each other.

We *think* that technology and science are all we need, but we are

The problem here is that every group who promises revolution ends up
being the same as those they quelled. Usually, at best, it's par for
the course. After considering the social carnage accompanying
revolution, it just doesn't leave the leaders of revolution with much
ground to stand on, morally. This is not always true, but it is very
difficult to justify a disruption in the (leadership/authority in a

### [The Power of Myth Is Diffusing As Our Myriad Myths Fragment](#the-power-of-myth-is-diffusing-as-our-myriad-myths-fragment)

The rapid acceleration towards the singularity means that any
prevalent myths in society are diffusing their power. In America,
these myths include historical figures like Martin Luther King Jr.,
stories of religious figures like Jesus, stories of ancestors, the war
stories of relatives, and even comics or anime. They all form a
arborescent semioteleological basis. As this basis becomes varied,
fragmented, out-competed, out-moded and begins to evolve divergently,
it becomes very difficult to empathize and sympathize with each
other. As a leader, crafting a message that invokes these patterns of
symbols becomes nearly impossible and you cannot predict how people
will respond.

If you didn't understand the paragraphs above: they explain how fake
news is effective in undermining the system of symbols we use to
communicate. Ever wonder what I mean when I use obscure references to
anime? Now you know what I mean. Language begins to break down as we
all begin leveraging symbols with poor diffusion and highly-varied
interpretations. Then we all start talking over one another. We're all
speaking English, but no one knows what anyone means, nor can any of
us predict how someone's going to respond. We can't have civil
discourse without bumping into someone else's triggers implanted by
fake news stories. It's crazy!

- Godel's incompleteness theorum and *decidability* as it relates to
  sociophysical programs, specifically in the limitations to:

  - (1) internal psychological compartmentalization
    - "you can't simultaneously play dumb and be worried about the
      damage done to your apparent ego when people think you're
      stupid"
    - that is, for psychological behaviors primarily extrapolated from
      analytical/probabilistic information systems, of which
      psychology/consciousness are emergent phenomena, there are
      problems of decidability that result from extensive
      compartmentalization of behavior
      - psychological compartmentalization is tightly coupled to
        behaviors a person intends to exhibit control over social
        circumstances, so effects descending from compartmentalization
        of behavior bleeds into social dynamics

  - (2) remapping language/semiotic signs in society
    - this has significant implications for information warfare, where
      *all* sides are constantly trying to remap and *own* the
      semiotic mappings that are distributed into society
    - as each side continues to try to propagate its own symbols,
      while coopting/subverting those of all other sides, this creates
      signficant decidability issues in society, weakening most major
      "powers"
      - not necessarily governmental/institutional powers, but those
        who control social resources that are dependent on sensitive
        information/belief structures.

- how decidability in socially distributed information systems by the
  tactics of information warfare
  - connect to godel/compactness/etc

- basically, explore how godel's incompleteness theorum applies to
  probabilistic computing.
  - a consequence of godel's incompleteness theorum (which one and
    how?) is that anything above second-order logic is undecidable
  - i believe this has implications for algorithm
    design/structure/complexity (via countability?)

For America, all of this *informational discord* makes it incredibly
difficult just to resist the chaos and succumb to internal social
conflict, not to mention all the other unspeakable consequences.

- the informational discord is necessary for our enemies to disrupt
  socioepistemic consensus, so that they can systemically (root their
  own narratives and beliefs.)
  - this include the roots of an incredibly anti-American narrative
    that paints America as an evil empire. If this component to our
    enemies narrative manages to root itself as a major component of
    consensus in America and abroad right at the onset of the decline
    of Western monopolar hegemony, then Americans will forever deal
    with the consequences of that anti-American narrative.
    - (TODO: reword this and render it as an appropriately connective
      segue)

The answer is to reinforce old traditions and build a new tradition at
the same time. To all Americans, we need to harmonize our voices and
harmonize our desires to counter the spectral nature of the
informational discord. As we begin to approach the Singularity, the
information economics that exacerbate this discord are going to get
worse, unless there is an artificial push to counter them.

So, we need to figure out how to strengthen those semioteleological
roots for our ascent towards the Singularity. We need myth that is
capable of riding this cosmic space pony into orbit, but not just any
singular myth. It needs to be capable of harnessing the
phenomenological evolution of society, particularly with regard to how
technology affects teleology.
