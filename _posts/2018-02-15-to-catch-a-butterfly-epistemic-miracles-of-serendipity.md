- David Kirsch & Paul Maglio: [^distinguishing-pragmatic-and-epistemic-intent]
  - notes:

- some extrapolations of information in sociophysical systems are
  difficult to compute. every person has their own experience in the
  world, resulting in a (socially distributed typology of individuals'
  experiences). When this typology is varied, the likelihood that some
  individual will be likely to extrapolated in an unexpected manner
  increases dramatically.
- (these extrapolations are easier to compute when assumptions can be
  made resulting in convergent information dynamics)

The idiot savant, though his actions and methods may be imprecise,
irrational, infuriating or just stupid, can occasionally stumble
serendipitously upon metaphysical diamonds in the rough.  Serendipity
often arises from a pure accident,  seen clearly through the right
glasses. The likelihood that an individual will do so is low, but by
ensuring a highly varied typology of experience via social engineering
for diversity of life experience, this can result in de facto
distributed computation.

When individuals are more likely to have streamlined and rigidly
defined psychosocial development, their range of toughts and range of
their experiences experiences is metatypologically constrained. This
makes them more predictable. When individuals great or small stumble
on those diamonds in the rough in their thoughts or life experiences
and your social institutions recognize true authenticity, this creates
a system of identifying and propagating miracles of serendipity.

### [Can You See What I See?](#can-you-see-what-i-see)

This is one reason that I believe adherents of Bhuddism do not seek to
change what they consider perfect already: the individual as they
are. I've thought about these things a lot. Every person has their
place in the world. Each one is unique, yet they are all similar and
self-similar. Simply by letting people be and encouraging them to be
themselves, one can derive information and value from their
experiences that they might never gain, regardless of how hard they've
meditated or how wise they are or how much knowledge they've
absorbed.

People are all different and they've been conditioned to be
psychosocially unique, which means that every person carries with them
some unique set of experiences. When you examine any individual's
experiences typologically, no matter their specific or apparent
background, you'll find that there is significant overlap with your
own experiences. Everyone approaches myriad types of situations and
some people have a profound lack of some of those types of situations.
By listening to the people around you, you can gain an infinite amount
of wisdom.

# [To Catch a Butterfly](#to-catch-a-butterfly)

Who do I want to be? I want to be the person who acts as though they
understand what is written above and they have the ability to live by
it. That is who I want to be. Does that sound like a terrible person
to you?

I don't know what people know about me or what people information
might believe, but I can't believe how much people seem to hate and
detest me. That I've been sociophysically isolated is tragic: I have
Asperger's and I'm developmentally delayed as it is, but I've had my
legs taken out from under me and I'm sociophysically imprisoned, which
means that I can't engage in social experiences to create information
about myself that would upend the official narrative. It is so
incredibly cruel and I do not understand it at all.

### [To Clip Someone's Wings In Early Adulthood, Typologically Constrain Their Life Experience](#to-clip-someones-wings-in-early-adulthood-typologically-constrain-their-life-experience)

To achieve great success of *adulting*, one must engage in regular
social development. The most effective way to do this is to engage in
a wide variety of activities. The dark corrolary of this: in/formal
social institutions *who want to hold you back* will approach your
life and constrain the typological expanse of your life experiences.

### [His Psychology Looks Like A Topped Tree](#his-psychology-looks-like-a-topped-tree)

If such a social institution has all the time in the world and plenty
of people to use, they can exhibit profound effects on your life,
without ever appearing to have lifted a finger.  They can render
social development stymied like a topped tree simply by figure out how
to use people in their social network who are 1&deg; and 2&deg; away
from you. Those people are close enough to whisper in the ears of the
people in your social boundary to exhibit profound effects on how they
treat you, just like [Wormtongue in Lord of the
Rings](https://lotr.wikia.com/wiki/Gr%C3%ADma_Wormtongue).

People exploit your own decision making process, which is best,
because then it seems that **you and you alone** were the cause of all
your problems. For example, they will encourage you to not try new
food or obsequiously weave triggers to artificial anxieties in your
decision making processes *to dissuade you totally from any new types*
of experiences*. There is a darker side to process engineering in
social logistics; where some *sociophysical chariot* systematically
manipulates your social boundary around someone to contain you -- by
whatever manufactured means and justifications necessary. In the long
term, this totally cripples you by shoving garbage into your
psychology and decision-making processes. This eventually renders you
helpless and alone, desparate for help -- and no one else is there for
you except for those who victimized you.

The key to understanding what has happened in someone's life is to
examine how they exhibited control over their circumstance: did they
have social or finanical influence? Did they have that ability
whatsoever? Who in their life had social and financial resources?
Further, if you never have access to financial or social resources,
you never learn out to play with your own chips, so to speak. *So you
never learn how to manage money or become social in a healthy way.*

<a name="the-tragedy-of-informational-baggage" />

### [The Tragedy of Karmic, Informational Baggage](#the-tragedy-of-karmic-informational-baggage)

In the show [Kino's
Journey](www.crunchyroll.com/kinos-journey-the-beautiful-world-the-animated-series/episode-1-a-country-where-people-can-kill-others-749557),
the main character, Kino, seems to want to experience all ways of
living for whatever reason. With this implied at the outset, the show
explores many abstract sociopolitical formulations for society. These
are presented as countries, but are each constructed abstractly to
explore philosophical issues with government, life and society.

In the first scene, Kino approaches a fellow traveler, whose car has
broken down. This traveler has a sour disposition and is eager to head
to a terrible place: the same destination as Kino, but for a different
intention entirely. The traveler has a ton of baggage and becomes
angered when Kino does not help him carry it. To me, this is the
exposition of two characters serving as a pair of foils: they have the
same goal in mind and it seems they share many similarities, but are
also distinct in critical ways.

I look at the traveler's baggage as not mere possessions but as a
metaphor for information attached to that travelers past. Regardless
of where he goes, he can never leave it behind and will always carry
it with him. He needs help, but isn't willing to leave it behind or
compromise with Kino. If you understand people as sociophysical
particles who have information attached to them, then the information
itself can be understood as particles, albeit more exotic and abstract
than particles normally are considered.

All the same, the particles of information have a kind of mass to
them. In [Speed of
Thought](http://te.xel.io/posts/2017-09-22-speed-of-thought-illusion-of-separation.html),
I named these particles as datums and iota. We all generate
information as we live life, some people seem to have more information
attached to them from their past. Sometimes information can be viral
and spread very quickly. If the person is a celebrity, then negative
information can virally spread. If the person is not a celebrity, but
still well-known, they can still accrue tonnes of information that is
untrue, biased or completely fantastic. Regardless of how it was
created and regardless of whether it's true, this information still
has the capacity to drag someone down to the depths of Hell. Once
information exists in the minds of people, it never goes away.

My own personal suffering has far more to do with false information in
the minds of people, for which I have been methodically stripped of
all opportunity to refute. Is that informational baggage yours? Mine?
Is it true? Or is it simply what more powerful people would like other
people to believe about you, so they can sociophysically contain a
threat? Or decide whether to curtail a tail-risk?

The only way I know how to fight: assume people are going to see the
worst in everything I do -- while hoping that if I bait people into
making their typical mistakes by flagrantly misjudging me with all the
predjudice that's inspired them to destroy my life and clip my wings
-- that eventually karma will fly back and hit them in the face. No,
it's not exactly healthy. I can't live in a world without truth or
justice. I'm sorry that is so offensive to you, America.

It doesn't matter how negative, constraining information is created:
whether it's true or it's false, it is a burden you must carry with
you for the rest of your life. Christianity supposedly offers "forgive
and forget" ... that's a brilliant idea and has brought salvation to
multitudes. However, I don't think it's going to work for me. There's
too much false information about me and it's not exactly projected
from religious people, yet causes religous people to judge me,
although they've always seemed open-minded and welcoming to me, in
spite of it all.

I have to stand up for myself, turn back these tides, choke the
channels carrying negative information and track them back to destroy
the source of it all. However impossible it seems at the outset, once
I do this, the situation flips in my favor. Even better, once I
obliterate the source(s), there's no more malevalent miasma from the
far-leftist's social fog of war machine. If I publicly humiliate the
sources of all of this, all the neutral people in the middle will no
longer be under their spell. They will realize how they've been
deceived and flip in my favor.

Furthermore, this methodical system of defamation by abstract poison
pen is forever broken for everyone who's used it and been abused by
it: FOREVER! Why? Because the common person does not trust you any
more. They don't believe anything you say. By refusing to give in, I
will destroy you by obliterating all the types of life-ruining tools
you've used to hold people back with information about their own
sins. Sins were not specified, defined and outlines by major world
religions as measures of suppression for their usefulness in
controlling threats via temptation. They are enumerated so that people
can learn early to prevent themselves from becoming slaves to the
informational thumbscrews of their known sinful past.

Today, this is more critical than ever as all information rapidly
converges towards omnipresence. Social media distributes information
never to be erased and the privacy controls are deceptively
meaningless. I fear that any digitized information will be used to
hold back any person who dared to speak out in the new millenium. This
is not the way life is supposed to be. Does it mean that technology
will make us cringing, former shadows of ourselves as *freedom of
speech* is rendered the mere *freedom to self-identify* for
persecution? The common person is terrifyingly ignorant of the
specific phenomenological potential of technology. vehicles of which
the common person is terrifyingly ignorant?

# [Trackless: He Has Destroyed Mara's Vision](#trackless-he-has-destroyed-maras-vision)

Every action leaves behind information. On hiking trails and in ice
skating rinks, the average foot traffic can be inferred by looking at
the aggregate information encoded onto the surface of the ground. On
trails, the short-term information is erased upon the last significant
weather event. On the ice rink, the session's marks are paved over by
the zamboni. A wooden surface contains within it an often visible
memory of every physical event it's experienced, unless sanded down or
varnished. Every surface and every building encodes within itself
physical form aggregate information that tells a story: when water
drainage flows shift in a neighborhood, it can cause major shifts that
manifest physically as second and third order effects, visible or
discernable in building structures.

### [What does it mean to leave tracks?](#what-does-it-mean-to-leave-tracks)

If you've left tracks, isn't it easy to be followed? These are sources
of valuable information normally filtered out before it reaches a
conscious level. The story painted by aggregate information encoded
onto surfaces provides you with probability distributions that tell
you about common behavior patterns. In buildings, the doorways, Feng
Shui attention magnets and other anchors in the space tend to root
characteristics of these distributions. You'll notice the carpeting
near doorways degrades faster. Around sidewalks, if there is heavy
foot-traffic, then the grassy areas near the intersections of walkways
will degrade faster and will almost certainly be brown, depending on
the level of foot traffic. The traffic patterns are rooted by the
walkways, which were often overlaid atop the well-trodden paths that
emerged ad hoc.

### [Marking The Bodies of Targets With Repetitive Strain](#marking-the-bodies-of-targets-with-repetitive-strain)

Even human bodies can reflect systemic pressures and behaviors, which
is the study of [Human Factors and
Ergonomics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_factors_and_ergonomics)
-- HF&E. Doctors and people with extensive knowledge of how stress
from specific activities gradually wear down the body could leverage a
semioanatomical language to communicate informally with each
other. How? *Theoretically*, people who understand human factors and
repetitive strain injuries could encourage targets to engage in
specific activities that induce a specific RSI that signifies the
functional nature of the cause of the RSI. This is similar to marks on
the body or in memories that are used in occult practice and
witchcraft.

### 歯齒: Where's Your Teeth?

For example, encouraging a young programmer to use Emacs can result in
a characteristic reptitive strain injury that any person with
knowledge of programming might recognize as a common RSI in computer
fields. If the injury is fairly rare, at least in combination with
information about the target, it can act as a signifier for an
initiate to handle the target in a specific way, with zero
communication. This would almost certainly never happen. Another
example: encouraging someone with Asperger's to grind their canines in
youth will round off their teeth and may act as a signal to anyone who
knows what that means, even though the target who acquired the mark
was clueless -- because they wouldn't want to permanently damage their
smile in youth. This happened to me around age 12: people have
noticed, though I can't say it triggers specific autonomous handling
behavior.

If you wanted to hand people off in the medical or psychiatric system
for autonomous, decentralized handling, abusing HF&E to induce
specific RSI's is the perfect way to do it, without leaving a
trace. Another method for passing information autonomously is to
encode meaning into misspellings, misnomers and bad information
planted into targets as "passwords" which loosely indicate handling
instructions. The human mind is a like a file system. To some,
incorrect facts and spellings stick out like a sore thumb. This
protocol can be used as a decentralized communication channel,
autonomous out of its reliance on semiotics to convey information
universally.

  - regardless of how proficiently manipulative someone might be, when
    you free yourself of negative intention, then decoupling yourself
    from any predisposition of intentionality, etc/etc... gradually
    becoming formless, you cannot be predicted/anticipated/etc.
    - why is this? is it because all manipulative/evil people must be
      driven by attachments to their desires/etc?
      - if so, are those who progress through and embody these states
        of mind necessarily pure? does this progression move towards
        an ideal that is the opposite of the being Mara epitomizes?
        - or is it instead a state purely devoid of the elements
          required for suffering/evil?

- someone who (understands, absorbs, reacts to) the presence of the
  sets of objectified equilibria that determine, is (wise...)
  - someone who is free from attachment to and desire for (obtaining,
    maintaining, altering) any particular set of equilibria is not
    only fluid, but incomprehensible to Mara (the Evil One)
    - they become quite literally invisible to even the most
      (manipulative/deceitful) groups of people, who can't conceive of
      someone who could not be controlled by desire or attachment
    - "trackless, he has destroyed Mara's vision..."
      - footsteps (Kino ep. 3)

  - wisely, they act today with the possibilities of tomorrow in mind:
    they conserve their potential energies to maximize any potential
    transformation they may need in the future
    - this is usually (...always?) best done by minimizing your
      informational footprint.

- when (many people together) become fluid by abandoning attachment to
  attainment and control,
  - this means that collectively, (Mara is blind to them) AND their
    fluidity. the greater the number of people who escape
    (self-ordained) objectification of reality, the greater the
    composition of the social fluid that is most agile.
  -

- of course, the inverse: the more people who are bound to the
  expedient/pragmatic/etc attainment of their desires, (the more
  people that are available for evil to use.)
  - (this section needs to be re-outlined)
  - these people will always arrange themselves hierarchically.
    - forming a "tree-like" graph with more and less tightly connected
      regions. the less connected regions are usually where the most
      and least powerful nodes in the social graph reside (~ expander
      graph)
      - but power always corresponds to a greater range of 1st/2nd
        degree connections across the social graph
      - at larger scales of social graphs, power can be seen to flow
        clearly towards some subgraphs of the social graph.
  - again, these people will always begin to arrange themselves
    hierarchically.
    - in some cases, the same people to define sin will *encourage
      some sin* as a means of creating mechanisms of control across
      the graph.
    - the people in control will be very interested in learning your
      desires/needs/vices/sins to entice you with them.



- Mara only comprehends men who seek the path of least resistence, not
  fluid men who do not conform to any worldly desires or mechanisms of
  control
  - Henry David Thoreau quote "the path of least resistence leads to
    crooked rivers and crooked men"
  - such a path is useful sometimes, but it's predictable. identifying
    the paths to people's [unstated] goals is the best way to catch
    sociopathic people in the act.


- informational baggage limits flexibility
- connect to rant on academic (et alias) gatekeepers
  - informational baggage making it "too inconvenient" for someone to
    be an investment
    - informational baggage: unrepentent drug use, etc.
    - people tend to think investing their energy in me would be a
      waste of their time because they assume that it's so easy for
      other people with authority -- academic, political and otherwise
      -- to tear me down.
  - however terrible and inconvenient details of my life story are,
    when i finally break free of these artificial sociophysical
    restraints placed on me by the weak and petty, it will be because
    i tore through everything used to hold me back with force of will
    and strength of mind.
    - at that point, everything that had been done to hold me back
      will fly back in the face of those people who sought to
      (mitigate me) by restraining me, gaslighting me and denying me
      all opportunities.
    - for example, people have sought to limit my exposure to
      academics and people with careers in technology. however,
      despite their vain attempts to prevent my ideas from escaping
      and to avoid exposing me to academic knowledge, in the end,
      these people merely serve to prove that my ideas are original,
      since no one except wikipedia and lonely nights could have
      helped me develop them.
      - therefore, their attempts to isolate me will backfire as this
        is just one aspect of my life experience or lack thereof which
        I will gladly use when the time is right.
