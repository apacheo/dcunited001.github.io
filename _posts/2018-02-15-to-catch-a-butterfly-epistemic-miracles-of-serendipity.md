# [Epistemic Miracles of Serendipity Are Incomputable](#epistemic-miracles-of-serendipity-are-incomputable)

After reading into this essay by David Kirsch and Paul Maglio -- [On
Distinguishing Epistemic from Pragmatic Action](), my wheels started
turning. I originally approached the essay to distinguish the
denotative differences between epistemy and epistemology, so that I
could dilineate socioepistemic and socioepistemology in an attempt to
describe how structures of knowledge are manipulated socially. In the
essay, Kirsch and Maglio quickly outline two kinds of human behavior:
that originted towards *pragmatic* attainment of a clear objective and
that oriented towards resolution of *epistemic*
uncertainty.[^distinguishing-pragmatic-and-epistemic-intent] The
latter is a complicated definition for random mutations of state in a
game or social situation to suss out some details or knowledge
structure. There may not be any clear purpose to it, but by engaging
in it, one gains information.

<a name="life-is-an-incomputable-sociophysical-game" />

### [Life Is An Incomputable Sociophysical Game](#life-is-an-incomputable-sociophysical-game)

Life is a sociophysical game: without well-defined
objectives; with both turn-based and simultaneous play; with many
games threaded into other games; where players are not well-defined;
with both schematic and inschematic structures. All that complexity
makes life very complex, when approached from the perspectives of math
and game theory. Most people operate best when conditioned with clear
sets of rules: for habitual behaviors; for accumulated event-driven
response behaviors; to define a system of values for phenomena to
either seek or avert.

### [Without Serendipity, Analytic Methods That Accelerate Learning Algorithms Are Depressingly Limited](#without-serendipity-analytic-methods-that-accelerate-learning-algorithms-are-depressingly-limited)

Because the game is so complex, Most extrapolations of information in
sociophysical systems are intractible and incomputable. This is why
the human brain is an *analytic* machine: there really are no
tractible *numerical* methods for solving the game of life. The human
brain emulates numerical methods by congealing it's plastic neural
circuits around analytic emulations of numerical solutions. Though the
computational capacity of the human brain is high, it's merely a
lower-bound on the upper bound of maximum computational density.
Sociophysical games involve reflection of information across socially
networked, biological computers, as well as the spectral convergence
and divergence of that information. If you do not understand what this
means, either explicitly or by intuition, you are helplessly trapped
within someone else's game.

#### From Majjhima Nikaya 26:19[^majjhima-nikaya-26-19]

> "This Dhamma that I have attained is profound, hard to see and hard
> to understand, peaceful and sublime, **unattainable by mere
> reasoning**, subtle, to be experienced by the wise..."

Every person has their own experience in the world, resulting in a
socially distributed typology of individuals' experiences. This means
that some nuggets of wisdom about life are *unattainble by
extrapolation alone*, which is one personal interpretation of the
above verse. Instead, obtaining these *radiant teardrops* of wisdom
requires perturbation of sociophysical models, where the models are
optimally speciated expansively enough to consider that you've
effectively searched the entire space.

<a name="the-typological-speciation-of-life-experience" />

### [The Typological Speciation of Life Experience](#the-typological-speciation-of-life-experience)

When this *speciation of life experience types* is sufficiently
varied, the likelihood that components of some individual's life
experiences could extrapolate in an unexpected manner increases
dramatically. This is because diversity of life experience has
effectively covered the typological space of life experience types.

From Kirsch and Maglio's essay, the notions (...) tetris piece
rotations to accelerate cognitive identification of options related to
those pieces in the game's playing space related to social physics and
life. Every person is unique, but sufficient familiarity with the
typological space of life experiences -- and especially the nature of
metatypology, which I believe to be like the Dao of the Dao -- and one
understand the "shapes" of people, personalities and psychologies as
they apply to life as a sociophysical game.

#### Astolfo From Fate/Grand Order

![Astolfo on a Griffin](/img/posts/2018-02-14-to-catch-a-butterfly-epistemic-miracles-of-serendipity/fate-grand-order-astolfo.jpg)

Further, these inferences extrapolations are easier to compute when
assumptions can be made resulting in convergent information dynamics,
which is exactly why it's both so critical and useful to be able to
connect everything back to metatypology. High-dimensional, typological
structures are what begin to emerge in the upper layers of
neuralogical networks, though any given set of weights with equivalent
accuracy can encode a similar analytical approximation of typological
structures in a myriad of ways.[^typological-structures] There are
algorithms that corportations prefer remain as trade secrets which are
made manifest in the structures of neurons, so we can never surpass
some threshold of neurological understanding without revealing
them. Therefore, whether they should remain trade secret once revealed
through neurological study is a debate not so different from that of
patenting human and natural genes.

### [What is Found Only by Those Who See Clearly and Never By Those Who Seek?](#what-is-found-only-by-those-who-see-clearly-and-never-by-those-who-seek)

The idiot savant, though his actions and methods may be imprecise,
irrational, infuriating or just stupid, can occasionally stumble
serendipitously upon metaphysical diamonds in the rough.  Serendipity
often arises from a pure accident, seen clearly through the right
glasses. The likelihood that an individual will do so is low, but by
ensuring a highly varied typology of experience via social engineering
for diversity of life experience, this can result in de facto
distributed computation.

#### In Which I Attempt To Visualize The Concept of Covering Typological Spaces

If you could imagine the variety of human experience as a space, what
would it look like? Then, if you wanted to leverage the sum of human
life as distributed computation, how would you optimize the
development of knowledge consensus? You would want to cover the
typological space representing the diversity of human experience, but
since you can't know the structure of that typology, then even
understanding whether your "distributed computations" are proceeding
in an efficient direction is itself a mathematically hard problem.

### [Boltzmann's Distribution, A Generalized Heat Equation and Optimizaiton for Distributed Social Computing](#botlzmanns-distribution-a-generalized-heat-equation)

These are the same problems that data scientists face when trying to
train ML algorithms to solve problems which are certainly non-linear
where the structure is unknown. You have to constantly introduce
randomizations for your models, wherefore you uncover the true
understanding of the Boltzmann distribution of thermodynamics fame --
and indeed the true abstract understanding of energy itself. Energy is
not a concept from physics. It is a purely statistical concept from
mathematics and it's connections to efficient discovery in ML are
invaluable. Though the specific maths are far out of my league, how
the energy of your ML weights in the space connects to the entropy of
the Boltzmann distribution in that space helps you determine how much
randomization you should introduce into your models as you're training
them.

#### Now, If I Could Just Connect All This Distributed Sociophysical Computation To John Nash's Work On A Generalized Heat Equation...[^continuity-of-solutions]

Connecting this all back to epistemology: how do we know whether our
understanding of reality is the "best" such understanding? We don't
and we can't ever know this for sure. However, we can reflect the
knowledge gleaned from each individual's experience back through the
rest of society to help us discover:

#### &#x2308;यही&#x2309; &#x2254; Whether it's possible for society to evolve to live in ways that are different in statistically signficant ways?

#### &#x2308;तो&#x2309; &#x2254; Which direction(s) we should choose to evolve if we are going to explore the potentials for life?

#### &#x2308;है&#x2309; &#x2254; How much variation is needed to understand whether various directions in these high-dimensional spaces have been sufficiently explored or could be explored faster?

![Kino with Glasses](/img/posts/2018-02-14-to-catch-a-butterfly-epistemic-miracles-of-serendipity/kino-riding.jpg)

When individuals are more likely to have streamlined and rigidly
defined psychosocial development, their range of toughts and range of
their experiences experiences is metatypologically constrained. This
makes them more predictable. When individuals great or small stumble
on those diamonds in the rough in their thoughts or life experiences
and your social institutions recognize true authenticity, this creates
a system of identifying and propagating miracles of serendipity.

<a name="can-you-see-what-i-see" />

### [Can You See What I See?](#can-you-see-what-i-see)

This is one reason that I believe adherents of Bhuddism do not seek to
change what they consider perfect already: the individual as they
are. I've thought about these things a lot. Every person has their
place in the world. Each one is unique, yet they are all similar and
self-similar. Simply by letting people be and encouraging them to be
themselves, one can derive information and value from their
experiences that they might never gain, regardless of how hard they've
meditated or how wise they are or how much knowledge they've
absorbed.

People are all different and they've been conditioned to be
psychosocially unique, which means that every person carries with them
some unique set of experiences. When you examine any individual's
experiences typologically, no matter their specific or apparent
background, you'll find that there is significant overlap with your
own experiences. Everyone approaches myriad types of situations and
some people have a profound lack of exposure to some experience
types. By listening to the people around you, you can gain an infinite
amount of wisdom.

# [To Catch a Butterfly](#to-catch-a-butterfly)

Who do I want to be? I want to be the person who acts as though they
understand what is written above and they have the ability to live by
it. That is who I want to be. Does that sound like a terrible person
to you?

I don't know what people know about me or what people information
might believe, but I can't believe how much people seem to hate and
detest me. That I've been sociophysically isolated is tragic: I have
Asperger's and I'm developmentally delayed as it is, but I've had my
legs taken out from under me and I'm sociophysically imprisoned, which
means that I can't engage in social experiences to create information
about myself that would upend the official narrative. It is so
incredibly cruel and I do not understand it at all.

<a name="to-clip-someones-wings-in-early-adulthood-typologically-constrain-their-life-experience" />

### [To Clip Someone's Wings In Early Adulthood, Typologically Constrain Their Life Experience](#to-clip-someones-wings-in-early-adulthood-typologically-constrain-their-life-experience)

To achieve great success of *adulting*, one must engage in regular
social development. The most effective way to do this is to engage in
a wide variety of activities. The dark corrolary of this: in/formal
social institutions *who want to hold you back* will approach your
life and constrain the typological expanse of your life experiences.

If you don't understand what *typological constraint*, every parent
that has ever successfully raised children knows what this means,
though they likely wouldn't recognize the vocabulary. Every child's
psychology starts off as tabula rasa and the typological variety of
children's experiences must be constrained so that they do not
experience things that they are not psychologically ready to
handle. However, when an adolescent's typological extent of
experiences is constrained in the extreme, this is colloquially known
as being sheltered. So, the concepts that I'm describing are not
incomprehensible: they are actually facile, trivial and necessary to
being successful in life or family. What is difficult to follow is the
language that I use to methodologically describe it, which is where my
power of psychosocial inference and extrapolation are derived. This is
what angers me when people do not listen. I can describe these same
subjects a hundred different ways: BUT I NEED SOMEONE TO FUCKING
LISTEN.

### [My Own Psychological Development: A Topped Tree, Isolated Like Veal](#my-own-psychological-development-a-topped-tree-isolated-like-veal)

Adults can be sheltered in the extreme via poverty, restricted
transportation, extreme sociological disruption, ruined reputation,
disrupted education and a myriad of other ways. I am one of the rare
people to have experienced all of those I explicitly mentioned. It is
rare for people to go through what I've been through and not give
up. This autonymous, decentralized chorus of liars that follows me
around like iron filings to a magnet has ruined my life by projecting
deception into my life to destroy any chance I have a socialization.
Every social connection I try to make is preemptively
destroyed.

Instead I feel like human veal, raised as a ignorant manakin as
someone else's alchemical humonculus, intended to be thrown around
like a doll, completely clueless to the nature of life, since any
actual parenting was so conveniently left out of my life. My extended
family doesn't understand because they only hear what my mom, my
brother and my sister have to say, whose narratives dominate
everything. They seek my total exclusion from social life to cover up
their own bullshit. My family acts like nothing has happened and
always portrays a socially compartmentallized view of reality to me.

I am unable to leave my abusive circumstances at home and completely
devoid of coping mechanisms when I leave, all while people are pushed
out of my life while i'm at home, so that no one sees what i actually
go through. They specifically refuse to respond to any argument I make
in writing *FOR LEGAL REASONS* and to cover their own asses because
they fear what people would think if I am to be believed. I'm not
trying to point fingers, but I need people to accept how things are,
*so that things can change*. Right now, that's not happening and my
family acts like it doesn't even know what it means to raise a child.
This is all while they blame me for being an adult child, *so that I
become the moral to their story for my nieces and nephews.* I am so
sick of this bullshit. When I'm dealing with my mom, my brother and my
sister, I'm constantly fending off every tactic in the "Abusive
Relationship" playbook, though since they're nice church-going people,
they always look like saints and are irreproachible. *G*, that must be
nice, huh?

### [His Psychology Looks Like A Topped Tree](#his-psychology-looks-like-a-topped-tree)

If such a social institution has all the time in the world and plenty
of people to use, they can exhibit profound effects on your life,
without ever appearing to have lifted a finger.  They can render
social development stymied like a topped tree simply by figure out how
to use people in their social network who are 1&deg; and 2&deg; away
from you. Those people are close enough to whisper in the ears of the
people in your social boundary to exhibit profound effects on how they
treat you, just like [Wormtongue in Lord of the
Rings](https://lotr.wikia.com/wiki/Gr%C3%ADma_Wormtongue).

People exploit your own decision making process, which is best,
because then it seems that **you and you alone** were the cause of all
your problems. For example, they will encourage you to not try new
food or obsequiously weave triggers to artificial anxieties in your
decision making processes, *so that you're dissuaded from* **any new
types** *of experiences*. There is a darker side to process
engineering in social logistics; where some *sociophysical chariot*
systematically manipulates your social boundary around someone to
contain you -- by whatever manufactured means and justifications
necessary. In the long term, this totally cripples you by shoving
garbage into your psychology and decision-making processes. This
eventually renders you helpless and alone, desparate for help -- and
no one else is there for you except for those who victimized you.

The key to understanding what has happened in someone's life is to
examine how they exhibited control over their circumstance: did they
have social or finanical influence? Did they have that ability
whatsoever? Who in their life had social and financial resources?
Further, if you never have access to financial or social resources,
you never learn out to play with your own chips, so to speak. *So you
never learn how to manage money or become social in a healthy way.*

### [The Tragedy of Karmic, Informational Baggage](#the-tragedy-of-karmic-informational-baggage)

In the show [Kino's
Journey](www.crunchyroll.com/kinos-journey-the-beautiful-world-the-animated-series/episode-1-a-country-where-people-can-kill-others-749557),
the main character, Kino, seems to want to experience all ways of
living for whatever reason. With this implied at the outset, the show
explores many abstract sociopolitical formulations for society. These
are presented as countries, but are each constructed abstractly to
explore philosophical issues with government, life and society.

In the first scene, Kino approaches a fellow traveler, whose car has
broken down. This traveler has a sour disposition and is eager to head
to a terrible place: the same destination as Kino, but for a different
intention entirely. The traveler has a ton of baggage and becomes
angered when Kino does not help him carry it. To me, this is the
exposition of two characters serving as a pair of foils: they have the
same goal in mind and it seems they share many similarities, but are
also distinct in critical ways.

I look at the traveler's baggage as not mere possessions but as a
metaphor for information attached to that travelers past. Regardless
of where he goes, he can never leave it behind and will always carry
it with him. He needs help, but isn't willing to leave it behind or
compromise with Kino. If you understand people as sociophysical
particles who have information attached to them, then the information
itself can be understood as particles, albeit more exotic and abstract
than particles normally are considered.

All the same, the particles of information have a kind of mass to
them. In [Speed of
Thought](/posts/2017-09-22-speed-of-thought-illusion-of-separation.html),
I named these particles as datums and iota. We all generate
information as we live life, some people seem to have more information
attached to them from their past. Sometimes information can be viral
and spread very quickly. If the person is a celebrity, then negative
information can virally spread. If the person is not a celebrity, but
still well-known, they can still accrue tonnes of information that is
untrue, biased or completely fantastic. Regardless of how it was
created and regardless of whether it's true, this information still
has the capacity to drag someone down to the depths of Hell. Once
information exists in the minds of people, it never goes away.

My own personal suffering has far more to do with false information in
the minds of people, for which I have been methodically stripped of
all opportunity to refute. Is that informational baggage yours? Mine?
Is it true? Or is it simply what more powerful people would like other
people to believe about you, so they can sociophysically contain a
threat? Or decide whether to curtail a tail-risk?

The only way I know how to fight: assume people are going to see the
worst in everything I do -- while hoping that if I bait people into
making their typical mistakes by flagrantly misjudging me with all the
predjudice that's inspired them to destroy my life and clip my wings
-- that eventually karma will fly back and hit them in the face. No,
it's not exactly healthy. I can't live in a world without truth or
justice. I'm sorry that is so offensive to you, America.

It doesn't matter how negative, constraining information is created:
whether it's true or it's false, it is a burden you must carry with
you for the rest of your life. Christianity supposedly offers "forgive
and forget" ... that's a brilliant idea and has brought salvation to
multitudes. However, I don't think it's going to work for me. There's
too much false information about me and it's not exactly projected
from religious people, yet causes religous people to judge me,
although they've always seemed open-minded and welcoming to me, in
spite of it all.

I have to stand up for myself, turn back these tides, choke the
channels carrying negative information and track them back to destroy
the source of it all. However impossible it seems at the outset, once
I do this, the situation flips in my favor. Even better, once I
obliterate the source(s), there's no more malevalent miasma from the
far-leftist's social fog of war machine. If I publicly humiliate the
sources of all of this, all the neutral people in the middle will no
longer be under their spell. They will realize how they've been
deceived and flip in my favor.

Furthermore, this methodical system of defamation by abstract poison
pen is forever broken for everyone who's used it and been abused by
it: FOREVER! Why? Because the common person does not trust you any
more. They don't believe anything you say. By refusing to give in, I
will destroy you by obliterating all the types of life-ruining tools
you've used to hold people back with information about their own
sins. Sins were not specified, defined and outlines by major world
religions as measures of suppression for their usefulness in
controlling threats via temptation. They are enumerated so that people
can learn early to prevent themselves from becoming slaves to the
informational thumbscrews of their known sinful past.

Today, this is more critical than ever as all information rapidly
converges towards omnipresence. Social media distributes information
never to be erased and the privacy controls are deceptively
meaningless. I fear that any digitized information will be used to
hold back any person who dared to speak out in the new millenium. This
is not the way life is supposed to be. Does it mean that technology
will make us cringing, former shadows of ourselves as *freedom of
speech* is rendered the mere *freedom to self-identify* for
persecution? The common person is terrifyingly ignorant of the
specific phenomenological potential of technology. vehicles of which
the common person is terrifyingly ignorant?

Every action leaves behind information. On hiking trails and in ice
skating rinks, the average foot traffic can be inferred by looking at
the aggregate information encoded onto the surface of the ground. On
trails, the short-term information is erased upon the last significant
weather event. On the ice rink, the session's marks are paved over by
the zamboni. A wooden surface contains within it an often visible
memory of every physical event it's experienced, unless sanded down or
varnished. Every surface and every building encodes within itself
physical form aggregate information that tells a story: when water
drainage flows shift in a neighborhood, it can cause major shifts that
manifest physically as second and third order effects, visible or
discernable in building structures.

If you've left tracks, isn't it easy to be followed? These are sources
of valuable information normally filtered out before it reaches a
conscious level. The story painted by aggregate information encoded
onto surfaces provides you with probability distributions that tell
you about common behavior patterns. In buildings, the doorways, Feng
Shui attention magnets and other anchors in the space tend to root
characteristics of these distributions. You'll notice the carpeting
near doorways degrades faster. Around sidewalks, if there is heavy
foot-traffic, then the grassy areas near the intersections of walkways
will degrade faster and will almost certainly be brown, depending on
the level of foot traffic. The traffic patterns are rooted by the
walkways, which were often overlaid atop the well-trodden paths that
emerged ad hoc.

Even human bodies can reflect systemic pressures and behaviors, which
is the study of [Human Factors and
Ergonomics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_factors_and_ergonomics)
-- HF&E. Doctors and people with extensive knowledge of how stress
from specific activities gradually wear down the body could leverage a
semioanatomical language to communicate informally with each
other. How? *Theoretically*, people who understand human factors and
repetitive strain injuries could encourage targets to engage in
specific activities that induce a specific RSI that signifies the
functional nature of the cause of the RSI. This is similar to marks on
the body or in memories that are used in occult practice and
witchcraft.

<a name="haha-wheres-your-teeth" />

### 歯齒, [Where's Your Teeth?](#haha-wheres-your-teeth)

For example, encouraging a young programmer to use Emacs can result in
a characteristic reptitive strain injury that any person with
knowledge of programming might recognize as a common RSI in computer
fields. If the injury is fairly rare, at least in combination with
information about the target, it can act as a signifier for an
initiate to handle the target in a specific way, with zero
communication. This would almost certainly never happen. Another
example: encouraging someone with Asperger's to grind their canines in
youth will round off their teeth and may act as a signal to anyone who
knows what that means, even though the target who acquired the mark
was clueless -- because they wouldn't want to permanently damage their
smile in youth. This happened to me around age 12: people have
noticed, though I can't say it triggers specific autonomous handling
behavior.

If you wanted to hand people off in the medical or psychiatric system
for autonomous, decentralized handling, abusing HF&E to induce
specific RSI's is the perfect way to do it, without leaving a
trace. Another method for passing information autonomously is to
encode meaning into misspellings, misnomers and bad information
planted into targets as "passwords" which loosely indicate handling
instructions.

[Ettiquette](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Etiquette) serves to
establish social norms that operate as semiotic signaling channels for

it becomes difficult to read information via deviation from those

norms allows mispellings, misnomers, details in stories and grammar
mistakes in e-mails to layer sources of information with a kind of
addressing system. This is nothing intentionally designed, it's just
how life is, but this informal addressing system allows you to hone in
on and triangulate sources of information, just like they were
*informational radiation*. The components of information, spellings
and stories that deviate from the norm can be used to paramterize
handling instructions with higher-order logic.

Moreover, the set of information-particles you carry with you contains

informational scent that can be interrogated in the same way that a
dog sniffs your shoes to infer minor details about the ground you
walked on hours before. Dogs have noses and brains specialized for
their reliance on scent, which is demonstrated in their behavior and
habits. They sniff harder when they want olfactory information that
covers a greater volume of air and can even sense directional
components of scent. Humans don't think about the information gleaned
from scent whatsoever because our brains receive only a fraction of
the data.

through which others can project their will? Why or why not? Would you
do so without knowing exactly what you are allowing your sociophysical
flux to manifest? Most people would not, which requires evil to leave
them ignorant of true causes and true effects. What desires, will and
objectives would you allow to be manifested through your hands as a
conduit? Does it even matter to you? Of course it does, if you are
someone who values your life and the lives of others. No matter
whether great or small, or artist, architect or pauper, our works here
on Earth speak volumes about who we are. Still, if we are not aware of
what it is we allow our consciousness to create, we will find our
energy used up and our lives dried out.

Moreover, if we are prohibited from understanding what it is that our
energy is being used to build, we will surely find ourselves roped
into someone else's scheme. What is good about what we and others do?
People love talking about their acts of charity, humility and
compassion. It is less clear what is evil about people do because evil
is always cloaked in deception. It is also possible for good to be
strengthened by works built in darkness, since it's difficult for evil
to dissect them and defuse them.

### [The Problem of Higher-Order Moral Systems](#the-problem-of-higher-order-moral-systems)

What is good and what is evil anyways? Can there ever be one without
the other? If dualism prevails -- which it does, in a way -- this
results in an incredibly complicated understanding for what is "good"
and what is "evil."  This is especially true in a world where both the
understanding of good and the willingness to fight for it depend on
having experienced evil or seen it corrupt those around you. If we
haven't seen the works of evil, then what drives people to work so
hard against it? How can people be easily rallied to defeat it when
needed? How can people know when evil has taken root, if they can't
recognize it for what it is?

If the above, more dynamic understanding of good and evil requires
patience, wisdom and knowledge to even distinguish the higher-order
good and evil from the lower-order good and evil, then, to prevail,
evil requires ignorance, attachment and suffering. It is irradiated by
light and the worst kind of evil will seek to squelch out light and
all desire to seek light before it spreads virulently. Regardless of
the lives they've lived or which wines they've tasted, people tend to
take action against evil when they see it. In spite of the sacrifices,
some of use will take up arms against evil and will gladly throw our
lives into the fire to save those we care about. However, we can only
choose to do so if there's enough light to choose to act when it
matters.

There are no independent causes and there are no independent effects,

all we can hope to do, individually, is amplify the good intentions
within us and dampen evil intentions. At the social scale, if we
dampen the tendancy to become attached and dampen attached intention,
we ultimately dampen the effects of evil and selfish desires: for
control, for possession, for wealth. According to the Buddhist
doctrine of

-- dependent origination -- the only phenomena to exist outside this
hopelessly intertwined, literal

to result in compartmentalization of being into forms, which entities
within the system must recognize along a stratification of types. If
you hope to make predictions in the chaotic system, your system must
take into account this *perfraction* of types of state spatially
distributed in the system. This results in an illusion of separation,
awareness containerized into entities distributed across the space in
the chaotic system and, eventually, self-awareness.

Regardless of how proficiently toxic your manipulative adversaries and

then, to evil, you have literally cloaked yourself in invisbility.

Everything that exists in materialistic metaphysical world originates
in the hearts and minds of men: both good and evil. If you cannot
allow yourself to intend negative consequences from your actions, you
cannot so easily lend yourself towards evil's intentions. That is, you
exercise
[discernment](https://sniggle.net/TPL/index5.php?entry=12Feb12) to
prohibit yourself from directing your energy towards that which you
find to be morally reprehensible: you'd never socially finance that
thing, give it a cent or *pay it any mind.* If you have no vices,
there are many fewer typical patterns that evil can weave into your
life to gradually pin you down. If you live virtuously, towards humble
aims and the steady accumulation of sociophysical potential energies,
then when you are attacked, you have plenty of capacity to respond on
your own.

When you suppress your sense of ego, you become fluid: your
sociophysical potential energies can easily be kinetically diverted
towards aiding your life or the life of another, if evil reaches out
to destroy or use. To become fluid, you must disconnect from your own
preconceived conceptions about your life. This does not mean that you
do not develop plans, goals or objectives, but instead you remain
flexible and balanced. You must develop acute awareness of situations,
so that you can utilize serendipity as it is presented to you.
Ultimately, you should develop in a generalized manner this ability to
harness serendipity. Preferably, you can inculcate this tendancy to
use what is presented to you so that it becomes unconscious. Life is
always handing you what you need, though it's not always easy to see.

What appears serendipitous and miraculous to you, might not be readily
apparent to others. Knowing that we are all one, then also, what might
not be readily apparent to others might be serendipitously miraculous
to them, while requiring some instantaneous action of your own. This
virtuous, selfless action may require personal sacrifice, but if we
are all one, you would gladly pay it. Mara cannot know this:
selflessness is literally incomprehensible to evil.

### [The Path of Least Resistence Leads to Crooked Rivers and Crooked Men](#the-path-of-least-resistence-leads-to-crooked-rivers-and-crooken-men)

Such a path is useful, for both good and evil, but even the specific
path identified is trivial. Find people following this path and you
know where they're going and where they're coming from. This is a
little-known secret to resolving uncertainty in human-behavior. Are
people following a path of least resistence? If so, their destinations
become trivial to infer, regardless of the charades calculated by the
media concocted to distract people from understanding the true
intent. Further, money is sociofinancial energy, find the path of
least resistence for money and everything else falls into place around
that. Follow the money. It's quite simple. When people place their
chips on the table, they usually mean business. If there's no money
down, who cares?

Calculuating the path of least resistance can be efficient or it can
be intractible. Path-finding algorithms are well-studied in computer
science and for video game design.

#### A GPU-Based Path-Finding Algorithm To Find Shortest Paths Through A Floorplan

![Path-Finding Algorithms](/img/posts/2018-02-14-to-catch-a-butterfly-epistemic-miracles-of-serendipity/path-finding.jpg)

Furthermore, floorplans that do not have loops allow people within the
building to make much more accurate assumptions about the intention of
other people that aren't even visible based entirely on the
presence/absence of cycles. This is because the discrete graph of the
floorplan forms a tree and is combinatorially less complex. Therefore,
if someone is walking along a particular path, the set of potential
destinations they are walking towards is also exponentially
less. Extrapolations about someone's path through a building are
similarly augmented when there are fewer doors, rooms and
entrances. These are critical design concerns for level design in
video games, architecture and many other fields. If you do not
constrain the design of your levels with these concerns, AI algorithms
may not run proficiently because AI must compensate for the loops.

Evil depends on our own attachment to our personal designs on life. By
decoupling from the specifics of those goals, we're convoluting the
complexity of sociophysical computation by depriving Mara of any
fix-points in reality upon which she can make assumptions. There are
many things people can do, rendering their behaviors unexpected and
incredibly disruptive. Evil will always seek to condition you through
belief and propaganda to avoid doing these things that make you less
predictable. Doing this can be good, depending on for whom your intent
appears more predictable.

### [Rendering Society Incomprehensible to Evil](#making-society-incomprehensible-to-evil)

Mara only comprehends men who seek the path of least resistence, not
fluid men who do not conform to any worldly desires or mechanisms of
control. When you render this path of least resistence difficult to
know, you've made evil's job a little bit harder. Such a path is
predictable and often quite irresistable. Identifying the paths to
people's [unstated] goals is the best way to catch sociopathic people
in the act. For sociopaths: identifying this path is what you can
depend on! You can literally depend on the callous sociopath's
tendency to maximize personal gains if you present them with a
situation they can't resist where they can't see through the trick.

Because selflessness is incomprehensible to evil, if we are all a
little more selfless and fluid, then society as a whole becomes less
susceptible to evil. This starts from the grass roots at the level of
individuals, who must autonomously act today to preserve tomorrow a
myriad of possibilities, unencumbered by the informational burden of
actions. Some action is necessary to accumulate various types of
sociophyscial potential energies, but uninformed action will instead
cause us to accrue a massive informational burden associated to our
identities.


- cultivating sociophysical potential energy
  - how to be most successful in this regard?
    - encourage others to live so that they are most empowered,
      providing the most value to others while remaining the least
      obliged with the greatest capacity to act when needed.
  - this must be coupled with the desire to liberate others around
    you, regardless of the apparent personal cost
  - how to remain most free?



  - regardless of how proficiently manipulative someone might be, when
    you free yourself of negative intention, then decoupling yourself

      - if so, are those who progress through and embody these states
        of mind necessarily pure? does this progression move towards
        an ideal that is the opposite of the being Mara epitomizes?
        - or is it instead a state purely devoid of the elements

trasformative effects to create a mind that is capable of liberation
in the conscious world, espcially from the fate of being a pawn of
desire or of the powerful.

Progression beyond the fourth Jhana is exceedingly rare, in both
transcending this in the state of meditation and in embodying these
understandings in the conscious realm. Meditation merely facilitates
the inculcation of these understandings. Speaking from my own
experience, I believe that meditation allows the brain's constraints
over the mind to relax so that the mind begins flowing in such a way
that allows us to viscerally experience the metaphysical realm. I
wrote about this in [Meditation, Conceputual Designation and Monadic
Metaphysics](/posts/2017-10-09-meditation-conceptual-designation-and-monadic-metaphysics.html). I
believe that these Jhanas describe a progression towards the mind's
experience of raw metaphysics, which is why it talks about an
increasing progression towards mindstates indicating spaceless
consciousness and consciousness without the capability of perception.

#### Please keep in mind that I am no authority on Buddhist thought.

I've barely studied myself and only hope that I can encourage you to
study for yourself without tainting your perception of Buddhist
thought with what I have written, spoken or thought myself. It's not
easy to make these insights, but the best advice I can give you for
meditation is to be open-minded, patient, to realize that you are
already capable and to understand that you have to try to not try. It
is a feeling of surrender to the natural state of the mind and it
cannot be accelerated by trying. If you want to make it anywhere with
Buddhism, spiritualism, or religious practices, you must commit
yourself to it. It's really not something you can pick up and put down
when it is convenient for you, which is unfortunately what I've done
all too often.

#### On the Symbolic Parity of Literary Translations

It's critical to read multiple translations of philosophical and
religious texts. Each one leaves varying degrees of satisfaction in
the parity of symbols to connotation. To be clear, I'm no authority on
this subject. In my brief exploration of classical literature, I've
found very dissatisfying translations in works of philosophy, plays
and classics. I never know enough about the text I'm reading to have
valid preferences, but some of them yield pitiful extrapolations
compared to others. The New King James Version (NKJV) in particular is
one that stands out as ... not good. After reading several passages, I
felt that the text had almost been edited, not retranslated. It feels
symbolically abbreviated, compared to KJV, ECV and NIV.

### [If You're Out There Generally Liberating People, Watch Your Ass](#if-youre-out-there-generally-liberating-people-watch-your-ass)

When people are freed of negative intention and equipped with the
knowledge of causality, the size of the splash they'll create pars
alongside the magnitude of their desire to liberate others. When this
is combined with a propensity to cultivate in others the same desire
-- [Bodhicitta](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bodhicitta): the desire
for all sentient beings to be liberated from suffering -- this person
may sow the seeds for a tidal wave in true societal change. All it
takes is knowledge, wisdom, sociophysical potential energy and *strong
desire* to liberate others, which is a bit of a paradox in Buddhist
tradition and one for which I should not pretend to be an
authority. In order to cause effects that do not ultimately harm
others, you need to be capable of being surgical with your
influence. This is why knowledge of causality is so critical.

However, if you are personally effective in liberating yourself or
others, then you can be sure that Mara will be there to chain you down
again, with her [three
daughters](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mara_(demon)#Three_daughters)
and the three poisons: attraction, aversion and delusion. Mara will
delude you with techniques like gaslighting. She will lure you in with
worldly pleasures, so she can pin you down, leveraging your propensity
to be controlled by desire or to remain commited to previous
obligations for receipt of that which you unwisely desired. Further,
if you are successful in making a major difference sociologically, you
can be certain that Mara will track down the source of liberation. To
Mara, people are not to be free, they are to be used and chained
together for profit and power.

> Mara as the deity who tempted the Buddha, while simultaneously
> conspiring to destroy him to preempt the self-propagating change to

- of course, the inverse: the more people who are bound to the
  expedient/pragmatic/etc attainment of their desires, (the more
  people that are available for evil to use.)
  - (this section needs to be re-outlined)
  - these people will always arrange themselves hierarchically.
    - forming a "tree-like" graph with more and less tightly connected
      regions. the less connected regions are usually where the most
      and least powerful nodes in the social graph reside (~ expander
      graph)
      - but power always corresponds to a greater range of 1st/2nd
        degree connections across the social graph
      - at larger scales of social graphs, power can be seen to flow
        clearly towards some subgraphs of the social graph.
  - again, these people will always begin to arrange themselves
    hierarchically.
    - in some cases, the same people to define sin will *encourage
      some sin* as a means of creating mechanisms of control across
      the graph.
    - the people in control will be very interested in learning your
      desires/needs/vices/sins to entice you with them.




  - understanding the nature of causality and the consequences of
    karma is so critical in understanding how to act without seeming
    to have acted or perhaps without having acted at all, which is
    crucial to preserving your sociophysical potential energies.
    - you have to know how to act to change just the things you want,
      while allowing everything else to remain stable
      - metaphor: curling and "burned rocks"
    - if you don't know how to act without changing anything, you
      cannot act to obtain precisely the changes you want without
      risking creating too much sociophysical turbulence
      - for your actions to create a response with surgical precision,
        you have to know. if you are forbidden from acquiring
        information about your circumstances, you cannot act without
        creating negative reactions.
      - for me, in 2015, it seems that there was already a plethora of
        negative sociophysical momentum associated to my identity and
        actions I couldn't believe were real myself. the people who
        had coaxed this into being did so assuming that they could
        blame it all on me, so they didn't want me to understand what
        had been created and worked tirelessly to prevent me from
        understanding the specifics and consequences of actions which
        I could not believe ever occured.

-
- who had social/financial/informational resources to change things?
  what did these groups of people intend to create? what information
  did they propagate and why? what information did they seek to
  prevent being unveiled to me? all you have to do is understand is
  that I had as close to zero social, financial and informational
  resources as possible. this is generally true throughout my entire
  life and whenever i begin to accumulate social/financial resources,
  it is immediately smacked out of my hands.

<a name="to-turn-the-other-cheek" />

### [To Turn The Other Cheek](#to-turn-the-other-cheek)

The destablizing effects of sociophysical turblence will continue to
reverberate across the social fabric until enough individuals choose
to transmute it and exert their energy in quelling it. This is very
similar to the problem of turbulence in aerodynamics and physics: any
time you have turbulence, your system rapidly loses energy. If you're
designing a car or aircraft, then features of its design that creates
turbulence near the vehicle cause it to be more susceptible to
drag. Thereby, the vehicle surrenders its efficiency to high-entropy
motion of particles.

Fortunately, social physics lacks the exact equilibrium dynamics of
purely physical systems with equivalent exchange. Therefore, one can
alter the "shape" and trends of sociophysical interactions using
information. This is what it means by choosing to construct your own
reality. You can choose to direct your attention and your beliefs
towards whatever you choose.  *Some of those beliefs might concern
information more convergently shared in reality: among these are
things called FACTS, which are often pretty hard to argue with. You'd
be suprised though.*

Because of the lack of true equilibrium dynamics, then by altering the
shapes of interacting sociophysical phenomena, we can quell
sociophysical turbulence without precisely equilvalent investment of
energy. However, sociophysical systems do still have phenomena that
parallel equilibrium dynamics, so events with large magnitudes of
sociophysical turbulence do still require proportionally large
investments of energy to quash.

By generally turning the other cheek, even when you are harmed by
something, you absorb the negative karma in a way: and you don't
unwittingly propagate the consequences of others' actions. Instead,
your actions allow you to, internalize, transmute and purify the
effects, instead of acting as a vector for propagating it. Doing so
doesn't necessarily require a net-expenditure of sociophysical energy:
you can respond to disruptive, unwelcome or rude events in this way by
ultimately gaining from them.

#### Tales of Zestria

![A Shepherd Bodhisattva?](/img/posts/2018-02-14-to-catch-a-butterfly-epistemic-miracles-of-serendipity/tales-of-zestria.jpg)

<a name="without-mercy-there-is-no-deed-without-virtue" />

### ["With Mercy, There Is No Deed Without Virtue"](#without-mercy-there-is-no-deed-without-virtue)




- absorbing and transmuting the sociophysical reverberations of
  negative karma (from the book on bodhisattva vows)
  - the line is "with mercy, there is no deed without virtue"
    - or alternatively translated as: "When together with compassion
      and mercy, there is no non-virtue."

    - what this seems to mean is that, even if someone has done you
      wrong, if you choose to internalize that wrong instead of
      responding to it in kind, then one can transmute the experience
      of having been wronged into one that is virtuous.
    - if you zoom out to a sociological scale, the it's important to
      consider it to be virtuous when absorb the wrong actions of
      others in order to move past them.
      - people cause so many problems by wronging someone they
        consider weak and assuming that person will turn around and do
        the same thing, perhaps by justifying these learned wrong
        actions by assuming that's just how the world works.
      - however, if people consider turning the other cheek to be a
        virtue, than even the common person can act as a kind of
        sociophysical "buffer" in the same way that buffer agents
        respond to changes in pH by absorbing acidity.
      - when a significant amount of the population prefers to react
        in this way to wrongness, they can act to quell karmic
        turbulence. when instead, victims of theft turn around and
        reflect the consequences of stolen goods onto others by
        becoming thieves themselves, the consequences of the original
        sins then multiply.
      - those who turn to theft to account for the imbalance in their
        lives are choosing self over society by finding someone else
        upon which they can thrust their bad lot in life.
      - when those who turn to fraud to correct an imbalance in their
        lives that originated from fraud, they are acting to reflect
        fraud throughout society. this is sustainable, if small groups
        of people decide to work together at the cost of detriment to
        society as a whole. However, reflecting negativity upon others
        is never the solution. You are only temporarily pushing the
        negativity in your personal life upon the lives of others at
        the risk of normalizing the malice that victimized you in the
        first place. In order to stop this, people have to decide upon
        themselves to absorb negativity. To do this effectively,
        people must be equipped with knowledge, they must be
        encouraged to network the social graph in a way that does NOT
        exclude people. It is never OK to exclude people
        systematically: that is what leads the excluded individuals to
        believe it is justified to act in a wrong way, which is
        incredibly easy if you've never been acknowledged by society
        or felt appreciated.
      - utlimately, what do people want? what is it that individuals
        intend? and what is it that groups in society intend?
      - and generally, when people accept "this is how things are" --
        and especially when this is used to justify wrongdoing -- they
        have ceded all the power they have to change the world. True
        change requires suffering and if people do not choose to
        suffer for something better, we will always stay the course
        decided for use by those in power.

### ["You Will Not Silence Us"](#you-will-not-silence-us) - Occupy Wall Street

[As I've written
before](/posts/2017-02-21-civil-disobedience-and-operational-strategy-in-information-warfare.html#natural-justice-and-the-human-condition),
take away publicity and you neuter any possibility of civil
disobedience being effective. If no one witnesses the wrongdoing you
endure, it may never change. The movement of Martin Luther King
Jr. coincided with the availability of visual mass-communication:
cameras and TV's everywhere meant that you could no longer segregate
society and expect that no one would want society to change simply
because they did not witness the mistreatment that African American's
endured. Suddenly, you had news cameras everywhere in America, in
segregated neighborhoods and even at protest events. Given visual,
visceral exposure to this mistreatment, most white people started to
undergo a change of heart -- because it was now impossible to look
away and to continue pretending that such incredibly divorced
circumstances in segregated communities were not real. Therefore, in
the 21st century, when political dissidents are completely stripped of
any publicity, you have robbed society of the avenue of civil
disobedience. Suffering is no longer witnessed by others, it is merely
endured and perhaps for no reason. Suddenly, there is little reason to
suffer collectively for change because there's not much to be gained
from it.

What is happening in America seems calculated to undermine any
potential for civil disobedience. Our leaders will not be aware of
what those dissidents were trying to say, and America is merely
damming up an impending sociophysical deluge: one that they refuse to
acknoweldge. If and when this deluge is unleashed, it will be
massive. This is because you cannot stem the tides of natural justice
forever: you must divert the dissenting sociophysical energy with
alternative avenues for flow, just like with a real dam. Otherwise,
that dam will burst. Just because you've made it illegal to
acknowledge reality doesn't mean what you do not allow anyone to see
cannot affect reality. You're just not going to be aware at all of the
nature of the threat before it hits you, which will be far too late.

# [Would You Like Some Tea?](#would-you-like-some-tea)



## Reorganize the following

- e.g. no one's ever going to cofound a business with me? i guess i
  don't care about several dozen business ideas or several thousand
  intellectually interesting ideas that i have.
  - no, i get it. everything in my life is a rigged game. nothing i do
    matters. any mild level of success i enjoy will be mitigated as
    soon as i begin to taste progress.
    - if i never taste progress in the direction of the gradient of
      success, how will ripping it from my hands serve to torment me?

- why wouldn't i find retreat in a buddhist monestary? because
  whatever follows me around the world will follow me wherever i go
  until i destroy it.
  - so "it" will follow me into any place i go, no matter how pure it
    is, to disrupt anyone's lives, no matter how pure they are.

- the only way i see this as possible is by waking people up, so that
  they see it for what it is, to force this metaphysical autonomous
  form, this egregore, to expend its sociophysical energy beyond it's
  maximum burn rate.
  - that's the only way to stop this. you have to bait "it" into as
    many simultaneous battles as possible because it's like a hydra
    crossed with a zombie epidemic.
  - this compulsion for networks of people to dominate others is now
    empowered by technology. unless people stand for something and
    refuse to allow it to grow, it will continue consuming lives with
    coercion and racketeering until it consumes everything.
  - I didn't realize this from the beginning, whenever that was. I
    have always tried to minimize the scope of this thing, but at no
    time in the past three were my words ever heard for what they
    truly were.

- informational baggage limits flexibility
- connect to rant on academic (et alias) gatekeepers
  - informational baggage making it "too inconvenient" for someone to
    be an investment
    - informational baggage: unrepentent drug use, etc.
    - people tend to think investing their energy in me would be a
      waste of their time because they assume that it's too easy for
      other people with authority -- academic, political and otherwise
      -- to tear me down.
  - however terrible and inconvenient details of my life story are,
    when i finally break free of these artificial sociophysical
    restraints placed on me by the weak and petty, it will be because
    i tore through everything used to hold me back with force of will
    and strength of mind.
    - at that point, everything that had been done to hold me back
      will fly back in the face of those people who sought to
      (mitigate me) by restraining me, gaslighting me and denying me
      all opportunities.
    - for example, people have sought to limit my exposure to
      academics and people with careers in technology. however,
      despite their vain attempts to prevent my ideas from escaping
      and to avoid exposing me to academic knowledge, in the end,
      these people merely serve to prove that my ideas are original,
      since no one except wikipedia and lonely nights could have
      helped me develop them.
      - therefore, their attempts to isolate me will backfire as this
        is just one aspect of my life experience or lack thereof which
        I will gladly use when the time is right.

### [Throwing Bambi To The Wolves By Forbidding Socioepistemic Information Acquisition](#throwing-bambi-to-the-wolves-by-forbidding-socioepistemic-information-aquisition)

*Whenever I engage in behaviors to discover the outlines of epistemic
structures -- viz. to socially inquire about the missing pieces to
explain why my life is a broken mess -- I am derided as a broken
schizophrenic mess that's clearly paranoid and needs to be stuck in a
mental institution forever*. Without skills for seeking and acquiring
socially relevant information, people are socially paralyzed. To be
sure, that's a fantastic vulnerability to breed if your objective is
to generally dominate people -- and if you ever want to make them feel
helpless, you can belittle them by calling them a lost puppy or a
one-trick pony -- while never giving them a clue, of course. Why?
Because America -- that's apparently why.

I was never equipped with these skill during my adolescence, but
afterwards everyone saught to ostracize me by meticulously
constricting my social experience, running the rumor mill at full
steam, fallaciously labelling me with mental illness, and figuring out
how to get my closest friends/family to do all the dirty work,
ensuring those relationships would be ruined. The most infuriating
part of all of this is knowing that **these
[dementors](http://harrypotter.wikia.com/wiki/Dementor%27s_Kiss)
depend on my social vulnerability to abuse me** because otherwise
they'd never be capable of doing this to someone without getting
caught doing it. Moreover, other people apparently bred social
vulnerability into my psychology TO USE ME, who now want run damage

would greatly prefer over being stuck in a mental institution like
some unfortunately suppressed delusional Nietzsche.

that's what happened. He's not the only one who sought to label me
this way: simply the first and no single person can exert that much

your position as a gatekeeper to success. Everyone will quickly forget

bioinformatics, neurology, physics, philosophy, etc -- preferably
something that would give me money or power, so I could prove myself
in a domain, where my accomplishments couldn't be overwritten with
petty drama and where the people from my past could not affect
me. Once I achieved that understanding of the human creative process
and applied it to something -- perhaps earning a Nobel Prize along the
way -- then people would look back at jamskating and realize what had
happened to me for what it was.

### (a little closer to ubermensche)

I eventually gave up on startups and began writing. I never got a more
amusing reaction from all the people who try to control me in my life
-- **I've been addicted to that ever since**. I don't give a fuck
about your money, your fame, or any of your petty measures of
success. None of that matters to me because it's apparently
*verbotten* to let me have any success whatsoever.  For me, life is a
rigged game and I'm laughing because, to me, people are the game;
*humanity is the game*. If I ever achieve moderate success, it's
because I've so sufficiently dominated all of you. It's because I've
done something so great that all your petty eichmanns have to go back
through my life and account for everything they did to me along the
way. At this point, I'd practically have to cure cancer: this
accomplishment must be so great, it outweighs all the falsehoods and
defamation. I do not care about what humanity has to say about me
because they'd never say anything that reflects the truth of my
identity anyways: *IT'S A RIGGED GAME.* Instead, what people say and
think is only useful to me insofar as it indicates whether or not I've
become great enough to unbind. This is hardly a strategy I recommend,
but it's just about all I've got: how's it working out for you? What
did humanity do to raw, unpotentiated greatness? You destroyed it
because you fear what you do not understand. And when I achieve such a
great accomplishment -- whether it's possible to surpass your petty,
judgemental bullshit or hopeless and impossible -- it will be so
great, but also good *BECAUSE YOU METHODICALLY TORMENTED AN*
**ALTRUISTIC** *PERSON WHO LOVES HUMANITY*. And you'll never do it to
someone like me again.
