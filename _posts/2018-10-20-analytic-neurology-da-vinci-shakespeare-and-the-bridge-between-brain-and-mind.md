## NeuroAnalytic Thought Experiment

(Recently... ), analytic neurology, a conception of the brain and
mind, bridges some very important gaps in the following fields:

### (What questions/problems does this help us reason about?)

- 1Ô∏è‚É£ #Philosophy (What distinguishes the mind from the brain? Are
  metaphysical forms universal (Hegelian) or materially dependent
  (Marxist?) between the mind and the brain)

- 2Ô∏è‚É£ #Psychology: How do J√ºng‚Äôs archetypes and ontological patterns
  (typologieS, plural) correspond to neurological circuits &
  structures?

- 3Ô∏è‚É£ #Neurology: If archetypes and developmental dynamics are
  represented by motifs of neurocircuitry, where form is shared among
  our species, is information that encodes this form persisted through
  #Nature (epi/genetic) or #Nurture (through social information,
  mostly conscious) or #Enigma (Hegelian metaphysical forms emanate
  from the structure of the mind and society‚Äôs intersection with the
  unconsious) ... ?!

- 4Ô∏è‚É£ #Phenomenology: If the presentation of informational forms related
  through the metaphysical and unconscious result in motifs of
  neurocircuitry, then how much of our brains structure would change
  if the #SpectralComposition of sensory data our mind processed were
  to suddenly change? (i.e. like the Neuro research where a sense like
  sight is mapped from optical nerves to gustatory or auditory cranial
  nerves) Or what is the impact on the mind‚Äôs structure in people who
  lack specific senses?) ü§®üßê

By establishing a #Neuro #Analytic conception of the brain/mind ‚Äî
i.e. by modeling the brain as an analytic machine and [universal
quantum-information computer]() each of those questions above may be
answered with at least as much depth as existing thought
leaders.

(...), this allows the psychologist and neurologist to bridge J√ºng‚Äôs
ideas of [analytic psychology]() to neurology

- mention that analytic neurology overlaps with the ideas/motivations
  behind [Neuro-Linguistic Programming]()(NLP) -- no, *not* the
  junk-science, gypsy side-show NLP of charlattan scam-artists; the
  actual ideas of NLP for which the side-show scam-artists provide a
  convenient distraction. (Œª), were my own theories of Analytic
  Neurology to be completely developed, then they would encompass NLP
  entirely and provide a language in which most of NLP's
  mechanisms/techniques/results could be explained.

### So, that #NeuroAnalytical #ThoughtExperiment:

- This may sound silly, but is a pretty difficult #ComputerVision
  problem to solve in software, but by imagining how to imitate such a
  software design in the brain, we can infer a lot of information
  about how our optical pathways process visual data, as well as what
  the limits are. Also, when doing this, it is unreasonably hard to
  operate your mind to subjectively process these if they are not
  aligned in the same direction... which is an example of a fantastic
  question to ask that has neuroanalytic implications => Why is it
  easier for your brain to process the image data and yield an answer
  when the diodes are lined up? The overly general answer: your brain
  is an analytical machine.

#### 1Ô∏è‚É£ attempt to operate your brain‚Äôs low level optical pathways...

- to identify whether one of these components has the same distinct
  #ProductNumber, without moving them within the bag

#### 2Ô∏è‚É£ Imagine this as an exercise in cutting and gluing the textures...

- from the cylindrical #Diode surfaces to identify any part with a
  code that is not shared by the rest of the group

#### 3Ô∏è‚É£ If you're familiar with techniques from #ComputerVision...

- like the #WatershedAlgorithm and #MorphologicalOperators, imagine
  how your brain preprocesses visual data en route to the
  #OccipitalLobe.

#### 4Ô∏è‚É£ Once the processed signals reach the #OccipitalLobe...

- then your brain uses #Spatiotemporal methods to process the visual
  data to sub/consciously identify facts & info to extract, yet you
  can conscious operate your brain to alter how this proceeds. **And
  this is the most important implication** In order to identify
  whether the diodes are of only one type or there are multiple types
  of diode included (without moving the diodes in the bag) your brain
  can to "cut & paste" images from the cylinders, while also
  identifying diodes that present with indistinct and ambiguous
  partial codes (e.g. the letters "IN" are used on many types) So this
  algorithm/process can be unsolvable, but your brain can tag regions
  of this visual image as "unsolvable" without interaction.

### Questions

- FINALLY, some questions that result from the thought experiment:

- 1Ô∏è‚É£ Does the shape of the diodes/components affect the hardness of the
  problem? (Yes, but why? because for cylindrical diodes, your brain
  cannot make assumptions about the regularity of the image of the
  objects. this makes the problem less tractible, as the specific
  orientation of the cylinders is always ambiguous)

- 2Ô∏è‚É£ Does the manner in which you choose to operate your mind cause you
  to engage different sets of neural circuits? (Also, yes: since the
  cylindrical shape of the diodes doesn't allow you to see the entire
  label of any of them at once, you either must ( 1 ) "stitch" images
  together in your mind to form a complete reference #Texture, then
  try to fit sub-images into that reference image, like pieces of a
  puzzle, which is impossible for me or ( 2 ) process the sub-images
  from each cylinder that are visible for Letters/Numbers to find some
  that don't match the known code (in this case IN4007), which is the
  process I have to take to resolve the ambiguity

### To Summarize

- While this all sounds dumb to put on instagram, reasoning about how
  your mind directs the lower-level circuitry of your brain, allows
  you to make interesting inferences about how the brain operates as
  an analytical machine. Feeling out the limitations imposed on the
  brain by intractible approaches to everyday IRL tasks gives you a
  ton of information about how information is processed.

- (sorry, this is going in my draft on a #NeuroAnalytical conception
  of the brain/mind ... but it's what i'm thinking about at the
  moment, so i'm putting it online LOL ... I've been working on that
  article (and others) for like 5 months and there's just too much
  content for me to handle. I'm just lucky that i managed to not
  discuss the #Unconscious in these rambing instagram posts.
