There is an engineered collapse coming. It is not in American
interests and there are those among you, both rich and powerful, who
are betting against America. In the age of data science, you cannot
bet against America and win. You will be ruthlessly destroyed and your
image tarnished until the end of time if you dare to bet against
America.

It is likely that your leaders in name have no idea whats coming
because they are going to take the fall for much of this -- therefore,
it's far more likely to be people 1&#deg; away from them. After all,
the man who is bound by all the money and fame and status they might
lose is not truly free. Our leaders will only be able to stop this if
they work together and if the people of democracies are willing to let
the petty accusations go.

There are *certain* trends that the rich and powerful seek to distract
you from. individually, each trend is not very significant.
Extrapolated collectively, there is no other way that the powerful can
expect to bear the weight of these trends, except by collapsing the
entire system. If this is the case, then billions will certainly
die. This is what drives me and invalidates all charges against me. If
you can prove to me that I am wrong and insulate humanity against the
consequences of these problems, then you have my will or soul or
whatever you want for free.

#### You Aren't Going To Let These Guys Ruin Your Life, Are You?

![Plague Doctors](/img/posts/2018-01-25-caelis-ruissent-avoiding-the-engineered-collapse/plague-doctor.jpg)

These trends are damning. Merely mentioning them may cause severe
consequences, but they are unavoidable and I know *exactly* how the
powerful seek to handle these. By leveraging the chaos to establish an
entirely new knowledge-base. An entirely new paradigm where the old
world is forgotten or remembered in such an incorrect manner as to not
relevantly connect to the truth. The real problem with this? Those
amoung you who abused power for generations, centuries and millinea
will get off without a hitch, damning the rest of humanity to a world
where technology seems like magic they cannot possibly understand. It
will be a new dark age, where all semblance of rationalism, science
and logic become dominated by superstition and the tragic mechanics of
power consolidation. I cannot allow this to happen.

The tragedy of the 21st century is that we shall never know of
humanity's true potential for greatness. Instead, all we will know is
the cataclysm that results from our greatest fall since time
immemorial.

The title above is about the fanciest way of saying: we're all on the
tracks about to get hit by a train and no one is worried about how
we're going to get out of the car. That's the gist of this article.
There's some things coming. There are clearly people who are concered
about those problems, but there are only a handful of people concerned
about them all as they impact each other.

None of these are happening tomorrow, by the way. Calm TF down. The
economy is not going to crash. It's only going to crash if we DON'T
deal with these problems. Quite literally, if we fail to control the
transition from here, where the sky hasn't quite fallen, to there,
where the sky is and has fallen -- only then does America actually
have problems.

And if you want to say that I'm alarmist and irresponsible for writing
about this? You're irresponsible. No one sees this shit coming. When
people realize they've been lied to and the sky has fallen, they're
going to be pissed about it. The won't be as pissed if they have
something to do about it before it falls. America is not paying
attention to the right things. You've all been hypnotized by the
election and everything related to it whereby you're playing directly
into the hands of our enemies.

Get up. Stand up. And fight for your rights.

### [Imaging Technology and Computational Medicine Imply Trillions in Collective Liabilities From An Accurate, Irrefutable Assessment of Psychiatry's Insane Costs and Benefits](#imaging-tech-and-computational-medicine)

Novel imaging technology -- like MAS, Spect, PET, and others -- create
the possibilities of neurological forensics and stastical methods
which prove the true cause of mental illness as well as the existence
of top-secret neurological intervention. The problem? If random people
naturally discover either of these, the are some really awkward
questions that must be answered. Ain't no cigar smoking dude out there
planning on answering those questions. Get real.

Furthermore, predictive medicine, including knowledge about gene
networks, will demonstrate trillions in damage from presrcription
medication, industrial chemicals, household chemicals and food
additives. What's made this so hard to study thus far? Many of these
are not toxins individually, but only pose a threat when taken in
specific combination or sequence.

All in all, this means millions of cases where damages could be
owed. This is all revealed simultaneously and the science makes it
irrefutable. I dont know how it will play out for each specific
carcinogen or downstream prescription side-effect, but for those
detected by methods of data science, there will be no question.

There are some in medicine, industry and science who already know this
is coming, eventually. They understand the potential conferred by data
science, predictive medicine and novel imaging methods. What would you
do in their shoes? To be sure, it's not really their fault, but
they're the ones selling products that everyone knows make people
sick. Suddenly, this is revealed simultaneoulsy, within the span of
ten years in an irrefutable way. If not handled properly, it will have
catastrophic consequences on the American economy. As of now, it's not
being handled properly because people still act like it couldn't be
possible.

So, what's the plan? When are you going to hear about it on "Morning
Joe" -- you're not. Journalism? No offense, Joe, it doesn't exist
anymore. Look at what's happened to me. People have pinned everything
on me to minimize the number of people tormented for being a
messenger. That doesn't mean there are no plans to handle this. In
business, problems always present opportunity, but these unforeseen
levels of liability imply socioeconomic churn on a scale never before
seen. This simply means money, assets and businesses will change hands
from those who have profited thus far into the hands of those who will
begin to profit from the solutions.

<a name="cost-of-medical-care-and-ubi" />

### [Cost of Medical Care and UBI, Along With A Failing Food Supply](#cost-of-medical-care-and-ubi)

This leave America in a pretty tough spot because medical technology
is kind of our bread and butter. It's a major export and we protect it
through intellectual property. That's why our prices have always been
so high at home: we control the intellectual property. If we don't pay
an arm and leg for it here, who will? On the surface, this seems
wrong, especially to those who are dying from lack of medical
care. However, this is a major pillar of the American economy. Ever
wonder why it's so hard to get universal health care in America? THIS
is why. Take this away and you essentially declaw the american
economy.

This brings me to my next point: if we can't profit from health care,
how do we cover the cost of health care? Especially after our people
have been subjected to these levels of toxicity, which promote chronic
disease? This is why we must turn this ship around. What we've been
doing is not economically sustainable. If you don't understand the
question, it doesn't matter how you *feel* about the potential
solutions. If you don't understand that question, it means you don't
understand where government revenues come from.

I want a happy, healthy population, free from the fiscal and emotional
costs of disease. How do you get there? By turning around the
lifestyle of the American Public. This is why Michelle Obama's drive
for nutrition was so critical towards what Obama was trying to do with
health care: if you cannot lower the costs of treating chronic
disease, you cannot sustainably finance Obama's health care plans. It
infuriates me that the Republicans are trying to undo this. Truly, you
are shifting the burden of longterm healthcare costs from the
government *back to the people*. What we truly need is for healthcare
prices and expenditures to come down! Regardless of how pays for them,
that is critical! Someone has to pay for it.

Further exacerbation of medical problems can be seen in the American
food supply. Here's a challenge to put the food supply problems in
perspective: go to any grocery store in American with a single mineral
in mind, besides sodium or calcium. It could be iron, zinc, or
magnesium, which is critical for mental health. I want you to fill up
a single grocery cart with the food that it would take in a single day
to get that mineral's recommended daily intake. It's impossible. You
can't, without cheating using artificial formulations like Soilent,
supplements and vitamins. Did you know that more than 2,000 genes
cannot be activated without Vitamin D? No? Why are you talking to me
about my health?

The food supply itself and the economic advantages we gain from wheat
exports are both threatened by the looming spectre of a drought and a
Second Dust Bowl. Why? The Ogallala Aquifer is drying up. One major
consequence of climate change and global warming is that the ice and
glaciers in the Colorado mountains will melt faster. These drain into
the Ogallala acquifer, the vast reservoir without which all great
plains farmland is devoid of moisture. That's right, no agriculture in
America's breadbasket. Sound fun? NO! Right, water utilization levels
exceed their replentishment rates. Those rates of replentishment are
precisely determined by meltwater from the Rocky Mountains. No ice? No
Glaciers? NO WATER.

This is why, when I pronounced the quasi-quasi-joke-religion that I
started, I declared that the transplanar entity [Cxor Apache
Ogallala](/posts/2017-02-07-oneirontology-semiotics-karma-and-moral-consequentialism.html)
was speaking through me. It's a reference to how important this all
is: without it, prices of domestically produced food in America
skyrocket. No one even knows it's a problem. There's also a clever
math joke in the name, but it's not worth explaining.

And further still, have you considered how government and society
plays out with UBI? Every citizen that cannot work become a fiscal
liability and nothing more. What sounds like an amazing utopian
society is nothing like that at all. It is a horrible place where the
only value of human life is in what the powerful can extract from your
life before you die, since everyone on UBI contributes to a massive
net drain on government deficits. Still sound like a good idea?  Then
read [International Trends 2020:
UBI](/posts/2017-06-05-international-trends-2020-universal-basic-income.html). You
need to check yourself before you wreck everyone in this country.

If you are in America, look around you. Who is "the enemy?" As
Americans, the enemy should not be you or I, unless either of us is
making a literal explosive device in our basements or planning a
violent act. In the first place, why are Americans the enemy here?!
It just doesn't even make sense. But do you trust a stranger on the
street? Do you trust your neighbor? Do you really trust your friends?
Your family? If not, why? Are they bad people? Or good people in a bad
situation? If it's the latter, *WHY THE HELL DOESN'T SOMEONE DO
SOMETHING ABOUT IT?!* We live in a democracy, don't we?

### The Need to Cover Up Warcrimes By All Major Powers

- These crimes are hardly limited to one power or another
  - this implies incentivization for the unforeseen destruction of
    data, either targeted or total.

<a name="some-state-actors-need-to-destabalize-the-international-human-rights-regime" />

### [Some State Actors Need to Destabalize the Interantional Human Rights Regime Before the Next Global Conflict](#some-state-actors-need-to-destabalize-the-international-human-rights-regime)

What's the problem with warcrime prosecution? Why are laws so strict?
Especially under the current legal regime? The states who discover
those transgressions only want to use them for leverage because all
significantly powerful states have enough leverage on each other such
that none of them will bring suit against another in the ICC/ICJ
unless they can be sure to finish them off.

Moreover, the laws are strict to mitigate the incentivization for
covering up warcrimes, as well as the tendency to recruit others into
your plans without telling them they have committed warcrimes, until
*after* you're threatening them with their life if they don't comply
in continuing to cover up their actions. It is incredibly difficult to
prosecute warcrimes and it is unbelievable how hard it is to be taken
seriously in America, albeit my own case is "mild" for some strange
definition of mild warcrimes.

Intelligence is trade in the commodity of secrets. These secrets have
confer more power when only a few people know them. This makes it
harder for your adversary to logistically calculate their actions
because its very difficult to homogenize information across large
governmental organizations. If you know a state like Russia or China
commited mild warcrimes within their borders, it is usually more
useful for you to keep that secret and *use* it as leverage, placing
it on the board like a pawn for blocking purposes. I did not say that
either Russia or China is guilty of warcrimes. It is simply an
example.

However, convicting Bosnian leadership of warcrimes? That's
simple. There's not much of a long-game for American intervention
there. That regime was falling anyways and America needed them to fall
pretty hard. My opinion on those cases, is that prosecution was
trivial to pursue because it would be an indictment of the leadership,
not the people or the state, in particular. Further, the Bosnia
military was suppressed and didn't have nukes pointing at America.

For any sufficiently powerful state, accusations of warcrimes are met
with subversive intelligence activity to kill, maim or otherwise
silence the victims and witnesses. At least, this is what I've seen in
my own personal live, which is ludicrous, since these are *warcrimes
lite* -- warcrimes all the same, though. And you're damn straight that
I'm not going to sit idly by and be a pathetic, trembling victim of
nothing, just because the federal government is guilty as hell in my
case. You aren't doing anything. You aren't letting up. You won't even
say my fucking name. Go to hell, as far as I'm concerned.

Regardless, as dark as this sounds, there's a need to undermine the
current international human rights regime and, in deed, the
international legal and financial regimes. This seems to be part of
Putin's endgame, as far as I can see. Why? I don't know. I would
assume that Russia feels if it gets some of its teeth back, it can
make more incursions back into Eastern Europe, slowly, without
all-out-warfare. Also, that, if it does come to all out war, then they
stand to have a better chance if some of those nasty teeth don't lead
to subsequent warcrimes prosecutions.

This is why I say: throw out all the goddamn neurological warfare
tactics you have -- AND kill it with fire. Make it public, so our
enemies know they are strictly off limits and always will be. Make the
whole idea of it **verboten**. These tactics have the potential to
destabalize any large power, given access to the technology.

We are entering a period of time where the international legal regime
is changing gears and beginning to focus on transnationalism in a
transition towards the post-Westphalian paradigm of post-nationalism.
What's post-nationalism? It's a state of being for the international
regime which is post-nationstate: there are no nations, except perhaps
a dominant global government.

The particular [nationality
law](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nationality_law) issue at hand: for
non-enemy combatants, what subsets of US Citizen rights do they have?
Do they have ny rights? If they don't have the rights of US citizens,
whose laws even apply to them? Or are they people who are meant to be
hunted down mercilessly by whatever is going on in America, without
even realizing that they should run or fight back?

The joke that the US government is building a wall to keep us in has
some very dark undertones to it. Why was the holocaust so big anyways?
Because the Nazi's didn't want people running who'd be able to live to
tell stories about the horrors they saw.  Therefore, you keep these
people in, which is why my low average annual income is evidence
supporting my case: I couldn't run if I wanted to.

I've contacted the Dutch, the Japanese, the Spanish, the French and
the Canadians about asylum, but I can't quite apply for asylum in any
of those countries because I literally don't have the money it'd take
to leave. It has nothing to do with wanting to leave. I don't want to
be here. On the other hand, if I did leave, they'd simply clamp down
around on my family and friends, who've are essentially loose ends in
all of this. There is no running from this. I must stand up for
myself. I must fight my own battles and NO ONE has a better chance of
doing it. So, if you plan on victimizing me, you're damn straight that

If you're a IQ 80 roadblock, make fun of me for PTSD, my psychological

what I was saying, you would be on my side, screaming in the streets
about this because -- even if you're on the left -- they're going to
be coming for you all too soon. This is not about left or right, this
is about a Deep State conspiracy to collapse the United States and,
apparently, I'm one of the biggest threats they've ever had, which is
strange because I'm partly on their side.

Another important question of Nationality law: how long were the
non-enemy combatant (NEC) provisions in NDAA intended and architected
to last? Does it matter? YES, it does. Why is this question so
important? It belies an intent to architect everything that's
happening on the supranational/international legal stage so that it's
only transient, since it's not intended to be permanent.

If these provisions were intended to last for a decade or longer, they
should be designed to face court proceedings and not fall to pieces,
in federal courts or international courts.  When these sections of law
are tested in courts, the rulings and opinions should contribute to an
accessible body of precedent. Otherwise, you can't assert these laws
are battle-tested in courtrooms. If these laws aren't battle-tested or
no legal precedent is intended to ever accumulate, it could be because
there's something else bigger coming down the pipe, which is exactly
what everything else in this article indicates!

karmic obfuscation wasn't so incredibly valuable, you wouldn't see

These conspiracies will tableflip long-held axioms about world
history, though many cannot disrupt too much. However, the story of
Columbus? That's a fantastic example of a cover story. New World?
Woops! Didn't even see it coming. Pestilence? Genocide? The death of
90% of the indiginous population? Woops! It was all an "accident."

These are the types of stories and long held bases of historical
thought that will be simultaneously upended: ALL WITHIN THE SAME
TWENTY YEAR PERIOD. This will happen across the world. It is confined
to no region, state or culture. However, the more you have invested in
these narratives being true, the more you have to lose if they are
upended and tableflipped!

The current power elite cannot allow this to happen. If they collapse
the system now or soon, the chaos acts as a cover for ALL their sins
throughout the entirety of history! It does not need to be like
this. It never did. Every person among the billions of people who
would needlessly die in such an Apocalypti-caust is a chance to help
set humanity on course in the proper direction. There is no reason for
so many people to die. We need each and every one of you.

This will accelerate while the masses are starving and thirsting for
real truth. not every narrative that will be tableflipped will occur
because the disruptive information is true. NO! Adversaries in
information warfare have never had more powerful tools at their
disposal for lie and projecting those lies across the world. It merely
needs to appear to serve the interests of the starving, impoverished
masses to be accepted as true. That this is plauasible in itself is
far more dangerous than anything I've written in this article thus
far.

That all available knowledge would become known by all can be
anticipated in ancient ages, simply by extrapolating social physics
with overpopulation. That all fabricated stories would fall to tatters
and that all would be judged for the lies of history would also be
knowable. I am not blindly asserting this. I would love to debate the
merits of that statement.

### [Intellectual Property Endgame: Not All Is "As Infinite" As You Would Like It to Be:](#intellectual-property-endgame)

I first realized the outlines of this trend around 2010. I've outlined
a [spectacular
draft](https://github.com/dcunited001/dcunited001.github.io/blob/sources/_drafts/merits-and-faults-of-intellectual-property-endgame-scenarios.md)
about it in my series [International Trends
2020](/posts/2017-02-28-international-trends-2020-climate-change.html). It's
a series composed of 20,000 of purely unintelligable bullshit, as far
as I can tell. I'm basically a homeless Michael Crichton, so how
would I know?

One of the most fascinating aspects of law is **circumplexo corpus**,
though I'm not sure I've found the proper Latin translation. It is
very likely that there's already a latin phrase to describe this -- I
just don't know about it in my abject solitary confinement. This term
describes the body of law and systems of law that surrounds the body
of law that you practice. Some systems of law are bottom up. This is
considering systems of law from the top-down.

Yes, there is an intellectual property endgame. Intellectual property
and copyrights are specified as "inequalities" in legalspace. That is,
they cover ranges of information, not specific instances of
information. This is very important because it implies that the space
can be completely covered, especially once STEM starts to accelerate
as we approach the Singularity.

These assertions are debatable, but because patents and intellectual
property. A component of the geopolitical strategy of the Chinese and
Russians will very likely be to disrupt all intellectual property when
the international legal regime is disrupted, as if they haven't
already stepped on our intellectual property enough. There's no
question about it. They WILL do this. You can set your watch by that.

The question I'm asking about it is: do our "leaders" even see this
coming and *what have they planned on doing about it?* Why the fuck do
they continue tormenting me, when I know ALL of this? Or is it because
they plan on *using* all of this and can't have people knowing what's
going to happen? They partially justify the complete blackout of these
questions by claiming they want to "discourage a panic" -- but I say,
we want to encourage actual strategy, not psuedo-democratic
demagoguery and kangaroo elections.

### [The Economy Will Collapse Within Two Decades And ALL Socioeconomic Flux And Churn Begins To Align *IN PHASE*](#the-economy-will-collapse-within-two-decades)

The US Government is like a hot potato ... for politicians. Not for
me. Go ahead and hand that thing over to a real visionary, if you want
to avert or solve this upcoming fiasco. I propose rule by loosely
bi/partisan [Thirty
Tyrants](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thirty_Tyrants) and a clear
demarction into martial law social institutions whose authority is
dictated by the needs of FEMA emergency government plans, when these
problems begin until these issues are resolved. It's hardly an
original idea.

Everything discussed thus far has merely been a potential catalyst for
economic collapse. The greatest economic collapse yet to experienced
in history has been preordained by technology, exponential population
growth, unrestrained connectivity and unrestrained acceleration in
information bandwidth. It's inevitable: when this socioeconomic churn
aligns in phase, it increases in magnitude, which contributes to
wealth disparity. When population grows exponentially, so do
individuals contribution to the magnitude as well as the per capita
measure of that disparity.

Once viewed in this light, it has literally nothing to do with the
actions or strategy of some [executive branch
politician](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Presidents_of_the_United_States). What
do the American people want? Do they really want to hear more about
whose fault it is? That's what the media thought, when they marketed
this kangaroo election.

This is knowable in the time that the eschatology of major religions
was being written down, which is why most of them contain prophecies
of economic collapse, resulting in starvation and mass chaos. This
isn't too different than the prophecies that Moses delivered to
Pharoah, actually. In my opinion, those things that happened were
knowable by a highly intelligent man who knew his land better than the
ruler of the day, depending on whether you tolerate more liberal
interpretations of the bible. The truth is, of course, the lower-class
workers often do know the land and its phenomena better than the
rulers, who can't see for shit from their ivory towers.

You have to understand social physics and the geospectral aspects of
socioeconomic flux. If you understand this, you can know that the
biggest collapse ever is yet to come. I don't know when and God help
us all when it does. It is actually far more possible to undrestand
this in ancient times than it is now.

#### [Emulation of Ancient Thought Confers Penultimate Metacognition](/posts/2017-10-30-speed-of-thought-sociophysical-postulates-1-to-11.html#emulation-of-ancient-thought-penultimate-metacognition)

Why? Because times were simpler, the range of phenomena were much more
constricted than they are in the modern are and, crucially, knowledge
of social physics as it relates to socioeconomic flux was more natural
and less virtualized then. Modernization has given rise to false,
artificial economic phenomena that result in very real opportunities
to profit, but are far less stable in the long term.

You need to read what Nassir Tebar has written on tail risk and
understand me when i say that cataclysmic tail risk event is
UNSTOPPABLE. it must exist because of the global economy's exigent
sociophysical phenomena -- both mechanics and dynamics. there is no
way to eliminate it because of social physics. it is like the event
that balances everything else. in a system with spectral or
geospectral mechanics, for every ebb, there is flow.

Give me a liberal that runs away from any debate with me on economics
and I'll show you a ostrich with its head in the ground. This is NOT
liberal or conservative; it's something taht we are all going to have
to deal with. The consequences, whenever this happens, will be
catastrophic. We can structure the economy to prevent the effects of
spillover, but this is not "spillover" because it is a spectral
phenomenon where all socioeconomic churn begins to align in phase. The
"geographic" aspect of it begins to melt away and all regions begin to
experience more turbulence than ever.

#### BIS Paper on [Macroprudential Policy](https://www.bis.org/publ/bppdf/bispap86.htm), That Friend Who Is A little Too Enthusiastic About The Rules

We all have one of those friends, right? Sometimes he's an asshole and
he'll turn you in for breaking the rules "because he cares about you."
But then, it turns out that he was right and you didn't realize it
until a few years later, so you make up with him because he was the
only one who told you what you needed to hear. That's kind of what
macroprudential policy is like for central banks, if cheap credit is a
drug problem. The metaphor breaks down thought: macroprudential policy
is both good and it's bad. It's going to lead to some hurt feelings
though, when some nation's central bank has its treasury bond issuance
chilled and can't dig itself out of a crisis with more debt.

Although I am incredibly skeptical of such tight economic regulations,
macroprudential mechanisms will help reduce the severity of some
turbulence. However, if these are not properly tuned, they may
contribute to disparity in how the spillover effects play out, which
leads to finger-pointing as some people will be hit harder and
penalized more than others. America is one such nation where we may be
lead to believe in the future that we were screwed by macroprudential
policy. The truth is that we were screwed by a runaway dependency on
debt, but when you stop this, it has consequences. No one wants to
touch the free-credit firehose. Yet, the other side has arguments too:
Keynesian economics allows you to capitalize on opportunities
faster. However, the cheap credit means the myopic and poorly informed
misallocate your investment in what resembles a hacked system. Those
same poorly informed people simply end up fattening the power elite,
who reap what they sow.

That this may be inevitable, I believe that the authors of eschatology
**may** have known. This is because all religions were obsessed with
prophecy fueled by social physics. If you read religious texts in
certain ways -- and I'm hardly a man with a true understanding of
theology or an understanding of any single religion -- but it becomes
clear that these people foresaw things using methods, the outlines of
which most of us can barely grasp.

### [Severe Turbulence in Forex Markets May End Up In Nations Making Baseless Accusations Of Wealth Incineration](#severe-turbulence-in-forex-markets)

One frequently cited component of marxist rhetoric that I cannot stand
is the notion that we can simply do away with money. It's an insane
and deluded argument that marxists find themselves overly dependent
on. The world would be a better place if this idea just went away. I'm
not trying to be mean. Just realistic.

To all the communists who say: in the future we'll eliminate money. in
the future, energy IS money. Joules become dollars, you ironically
overgrown Marxist cumstains. Drown in your own ignorance if you'd
like, but the rest of us are trying to save ourselves and we don't
need your pseudo-economic gurgling. Stop gurgling and drown: the world
would be so much better off if your sardonically materialistic
philosophy never existed.

- large evaporations and diffusions of wealth may
  preordain/foreshadow/initiate conflict.

The notion that we could have a society without money is bizarre, yet
I hear it all the time. No man is an island and no economy is an
island. Even if your economy has no concept of money, it still needs
to trade with other people and other economies. What is money? Yes,
money is an abstraction; it’s a virtual commodity that stands as a
placeholder for truly valuable commodities. But what is money? What is
its essential role in society?

Money represents society’s ability to quantify resources and trade. It
is essential to quantification of commerce and of needs for human
life. You cannot have a well-functioning society without money. As
technology progresses in the 21st century, we will find that the
ultimate resource to quantify is energy. Accumulated energy is the
potential to do work, in the physical world and the informational
realm. Energy will replace money, but it is still something that needs
to be quantified and accumulated. There is no 22nd century society
without a need for quantification of resources and/or energy.
Therefore, society will always need something like money.

Forex destabalization isn't that bad. However, the renewables market
and international climate control policy is only part of the
problem. The labor markets, the geographic disparity in automation's
contribution to the lack thereof, speculation on Wall Street and
unwisely warranted derivatives further exacerbate currency
destabalization.

Calm the fuck down. We have Bitcoin and no one's destabalizing
that. It is quantum resistent ... After publishing this I think you'll
find that some Bitcoin traders will need a new pair of pants. Its

#### Investing With The Holy Spirit!

That was one of the most eye-opening lectures I ever watched on
international finance. This is why I give everyone a chance. I try to
listen, no matter who I'm talking to. I know it's hard to understand
me sometimes. That guy? Genius. I'm not sure I can recommend his fund
for investments, but he definitely knows his stuff. You're about to
disover what it means to live under the thumb of an alternative truly
exploitative international financial regime to which we are forever
enslaved. You are idiots. if and when this comes to pass, you will
truly understand how your far-left belligerence was **TREASON**.

Follow the money -- or at least follow the future incentivization
structures -- and it leads to the Chinese and their novel
interantional world order du jour: BRICS/AIIB/NDB/CIPS (BANC). BANC is
yet another system whose outlines are in place, which indicates the
orchestration of sophisticated plots against America. Furthermore,
Their CIPS payment system allows terrorists to subvert wester
anti-terrorism laws that protect us against terror groups utilizing
wire-transfer. In general, asians have an incentive to work together,
but the Japanese do not want to become subservient to the Chinese.

This BANC *must* be the exigent destination of China's endgame.
They've already bet on this horse until the end: all roads will lead
to BANC, if they don't already. Dominance over international finance
-- and simply moderate influence over it -- confers unimanginable
power.

My own opinions with regard to this scenario come after coming to
understand decades of Chinese contempt and antagonism with regard to
intellectual property, like copyrights, patents and even military
trade secrets. I understand what they're getting at. They simply do
not enforce these international norm within their own borders and
steal so much from Western interests. They assume that we'll never
know what goes on behind closed borders. It all goes back to many of
the philosophical underpinnings of Marxism, by the way, but Communism
has actually worked well for the Chinese. The development they've
acheived over the past six decades is amazing. However, communism will
not work so well in America.

They've weakened us by copying and stealing our patented technology.
They've stolen our military trade-secret technology, which they will
use to manufacture competitive military products they plan on selling
to the satellite states within their sphere of influence.  They plan
on beating us with our own military technology. They've poisoned our
children with melanin. They've shipped Fentanyl to America. They're
putting pressure in Pakistan and even the Khyber Pass in Afganistan,
in anticipation to dominate the Heroin market to fund black ops
worldwide. They've led us astray by using the greed of our wealthiest
as a weapon.


If my intuition serves me right, this will essentially be the same as
getting trapped with high-debt during a deflationary crisis,
especially if debts become rewritten in terms of a Bitcoin/dollar
exchange rate at a low dollar value. They're about to make fools of
all Americans, who will become their debt-slaves forever in an
international finance and monetery scheme rigged so that Americans can
never escape debt.

Regardless, we're not going to let this happen. That's not to say that
Americans aren't willing to work with the Chinese, but we are not
fools. We must work together with China. We do not want to be your
enemy, but your plans are fairly simple to understand. However, we are
not going to fight a war because that's insane ... or is it?

No, this will quickly become a cold conflict, which will play out
similarly to the first Cold War. Our victory will be predicated
through expansion via authentically symbiotic Foreign Domestic
Investment and other economic/poltical means. Towards authentically
symbiotic fiscal relationships, America has more to offer *because of
our diversity and connectedness* than China could ever dream of.

This is why Americans must focus outwards and not inwards. Everything
about the election and your obsessive focus on the results has been a
carefully laid trap, though I am so censured on Facebook and Twitter
newsfeed algorithms, no one could possibly hear what I have to say
through all the weight of my algorithmic demerit points. Thanks a lot.

China, in the coming years, we will not need your industrial
capacity. No one will because that's the trend that emerges as
fabrication technology becomes available. This is not accounted for in
explanations proffered by economics professors because they don't yet
understand how fab-tech challenges previously held axioms of
economics. Therefore, China, you cannot depend on nations needing your
attractively cheap, burgeoning industrial capacity, so if you're
calculating your geopolitcal moves with that, think again.

against America. It is foolish because, regardless of how this plays
out, you will lose if America falls. There is simply no other way.

#### If you are European, DO NOT bet against America.

It is NOT in your interests. You may be pleasantly amused at the
American kangaroo election, but that is all by design. It's a
distraction. If even five of these things come to pass, who will be
there to stand for your defense? What will become of NATO then? Europe
will fall because Europe has become weak, which is the only point
Trump was trying to make about NATO during the election. How did the
media spin that?

The 2008 financial collapse harnessed the fractures of aligned Jingo
tower of derivatives and debt. It may at least be seen as an
catastrophic accident of unrestrained, unregulated greed. In the
context of this scheme for the international financial regime to
change hands, how does that play out for Europe and American allies?
It doesn't, does it? Let me ask you one more time: IT DOESN'T, DOES
IT? We just need to be sure, so get in line and get ready to follow or
at least get out of the way.

#### Keep In Mind How Viciously America Has Defended The Dollar.

### [Energy And Resource Markets Give Rise To A Peak Oil Forever Scenario, If The Population Is Truncated](#energy-and-resource-markets-give-rise-to-a-peak-oil-forever-scenario)



- describe how to extend peak oil forever. not just peak oil; peak
  everything, forever.
  - something cheeky about [conflict theory](/posts/2016-10-12-cosmic-disruption-of-conflict-theory.html)
    - An idea from Marx that I believe sums up conflict...


#### Peak Autism: Is The End Really Nigh?

![Peak Autism](/img/posts/2018-01-25-caelis-ruissent-avoiding-the-engineered-collapse/peak-autism.jpg)

- for the uberelite, the problem is not access to supply, nor is it
  exponential increases in demand, nor is it inconsistent fluctuations
  in demand. the problem is consumption. rates of consumtion are too
  high. at first glance, this seems to be equivalent to demand, but
  it's not. it's demand when adjusted for population and the upward
  pressure that population has on price over time.
  - in other words, the powerful would like to extend peak-X forever,
    but they can only do so by limiting.

This brings me to some interesting correlations between renewable
energy, cryptocurrency currency mining and data flows --
e.g. Canadians mining bitcoin in Romania. In some cases, it may be
more efficient (or profitable) to use excess renewables to mine
cryptocurrency or facillitate ethereum operations than to store or
transport it, however cheap that might be.

This might give rise to novel types of financial flows that would
essentially be bundled as assets or derivatives. **Is every greedy
Marxist going to steal this idea too?** You're essentially betting
that crypto activity will be more profitable than selling/storing the
electricity -- either now or in the future. Eventually, investments
could be bundled or facilitated as novel types of crypto futures,
among other creative derivatives.

- TODO: reference stochastic programming article

These derivatives differ starkly from the "Bitcoin futures" of
today. They also depend on your capacity and need to store energy. If
you run out of local energy storage or if energy transfer
infrastructure is overloaded/disrupted, then the best option is almost
always crypto mining or ethereum. This could lead to shady finance
schemes not yet seen, whereby profits are accrued and financial hopes
dashed through the discouragement and manipulation of the architecture
or development of both energy storage and infrastructure in countries
across the world. If there is less infrastructure, generally, than
it's easier to influence to short the derivatives mentioned
above. It's like measuring the influence that removing small numbers
of nodes in algebraic graph theory, no doubt connected to (albuin
numbers). The more connected the graph is and the more nodes there
are, generally, the less potential for disruption there is when a
small number of nodes are randomly removed. Control the development of
infrastructure and generally increase the potential for profit via the
structure of nodes on the "graph" of energy infrastructure.

- [Albuin numbers]().



Again, steal all my ideas. I don't actually care. I have so many that
my mind itself is considered a global security threat, apparently.
Isn't that wonderful? All you motherfucking crypto-Leninist shitdicks
have to deal with the consequences for fucking me in the ass all this
time. Because, apparently, what comes out of my mind isn't so
worthless as you'd like my family, friends and everyone in the world
to think.

I'd like to see some of you sit there and read my articles aloud on
video. It would probably be amusing, though I'd really prefer to
massage and facilitate your understanding of what I have to say
because it only matters if you actually understand it. Instead you run
away from every debate opportunity like an ostrich with its head cut
off. Not see that, you assholes. How are you going to disconnect me
now?

### Destroying Most Humans Makes Cultural Data More Digitally Compact For AI

- some of the academic elite might try to justify such a global
  collapse as an attempt to avoid a destroy-all-humans scenario
  - this only holds water if a hyperintelligent artificial
    intelligence being would blindly seek to eliminate competition for
    energy.

### Billions of People Will Die In A Plan To Orchestrate Collapse, Simply to Shield Guilty-as-Hell Deep-State Actors

- how do you stop it? by doing the opposite of what these people hate:
  spreading information around and making it as permanent as possible,
  even if you have to print it out, laminate it and bury on the
  Appalachain Trail.

### For The Global Elite, The Best Way To Handle, Mitigate and Explain The Emerging Chaos, Along With The Ensuing Blame To Be Cast, Is To Collapse the System

Instead, almost everyone just wants to shoot the messenger. The one
with the message you need to hear. What you need to hear is NOT what
you want to hear! Deal with it because this is real. It's not going
away: it hasn't come to pass yet, but it will. When it happens, you
will be thanking your stars that someone like me ever existed.

- TODO: more here. why does systemic collapse check all the boxes for
  these people?

- these are the people that have moderately controlled the evolution
  of language. They have have architected history: the pattern of
  myths that for the base paradigms of our collective narratives for
  explaining who we are and how we got to where we are. Regardless of
  where we live, we all have a collective story for how we got there
  and this narrative motivates our actions. Stories in history are
  like patterns for sewing clothes: each one provides a convenient
  basis by which we compare not only heroes, pariahs and demagogues,
  but ourselves and each other.
  - What does the illuminati do to people they detest? They freeze
    them in carbonite, so to speak. If you actually manage to make
    waves, you become frozen into history after death, completely
    unable to control the evolution of your narrative, which is
    partially what men fear so much that makes the idea of heaven so
    appealing. Regardless of whether it's real or not, heaven is an
    idea of the place you spend for eternity, if you only believed in
    the vision of Jesus Christ. It the idea itself at least has
    power. Men fear how their stories will play out after their lives,
    since they'd have no power against their enemies to sew them into
    narratives and dominate the tellings of their stories.
    - *In my own interpretation*, those who rot in hell are forgotten
      because, to the church, these people did not stand for what was
      critical: the collective, geopoltical self-defense of Europe or
      its expansion into the New World. Those who ascend to heaven are
      instead preserved, but collectively coupled to the image of
      Jesus Christ forever. This is a magnificent fate, compared to
      the obliviation of Hell.
  - Hell is not always a literal obliviation. If you piss off people
    who are powerful enough, your image and identity will spend
    eternity as a pattern for a story in which you are hardly the
    hero. Instead you are the fool or the pawn who is to be hated and
    detested for eternity, whose story is to be propagated by the
    occult as long as possible.
  - See why I might be a little pissed off? Who stands to defend
    themselves most, after death? Those with the social and financial
    resources to set in motion plans which carry themselves out.



More than anything, these überelite fear the contagion of information
that disrupts their meticulous calculations, whose moral
consequentialist ends are maintained as vague at best and unknown to
nearly all. That is by design.

This is why anyone who stands against them will be tested, then
humiliated publicly, but only if they manage to make it far enough to
be a thorn in some banking family's side. <spit/> At the same time,
this person will be stripped of their identity. Like a traitor in
Dante's 9th Circle of Hell, their head will be encased in a block of
ICE and they shall be buried alive, upside down. Not even memory of
their identity shall remain.

But please, keep in mind, not all banking family's are the
same. No, one profits at the demise of others. There is vicious
competition among the illuminati elite. AND NO "BANKING FAMILY" IS NOT
A CODE PHRASE FOR JEWS, TATIANA.
