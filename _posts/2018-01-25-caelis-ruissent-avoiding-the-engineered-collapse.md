There is an engineered collapse coming. It is not in American
interests and there are those among you, both rich and powerful, who
are betting against America. In the age of data science, you cannot
bet against America and win. You will be ruthlessly destroyed and your
image tarnished until the end of time if you dare to bet against
America.

It is likely that your leaders in name have no idea whats coming
because they are going to take the fall for much of this -- therefore,
it's far more likely to be people 1&#deg; away from them. After all,
the man who is bound by all the money and fame and status they might
lose is not truly free. Our leaders will only be able to stop this if
they work together and if the people of democracies are willing to let
the petty accusations go.

There are *certain* trends that the rich and powerful seek to distract
you from. individually, each trend is not very significant.
Extrapolated collectively, there is no other way that the powerful can
expect to bear the weight of these trends, except by collapsing the
entire system. If this is the case, then billions will certainly
die. This is what drives me and invalidates all charges against me. If
you can prove to me that I am wrong and insulate humanity against the
consequences of these problems, then you have my will or soul or
whatever you want for free.

#### You Aren't Going To Let These Guys Ruin Your Life, Are You?

![Plague Doctors](/img/posts/2018-01-25-caelis-ruissent-avoiding-the-engineered-collapse/plague-doctor.jpg)

These trends are damning. Merely mentioning them may cause severe
consequences, but they are unavoidable and I know *exactly* how the
powerful seek to handle these. By leveraging the chaos to establish an
entirely new knowledge-base. An entirely new paradigm where the old
world is forgotten or remembered in such an incorrect manner as to not
relevantly connect to the truth. The real problem with this? Those
amoung you who abused power for generations, centuries and millinea
will get off without a hitch, damning the rest of humanity to a world
where technology seems like magic they cannot possibly understand. It
will be a new dark age, where all semblance of rationalism, science
and logic become dominated by superstition and the tragic mechanics of
power consolidation. I cannot allow this to happen.

The tragedy of the 21st century is that we shall never know of
humanity's true potential for greatness. Instead, all we will know is
the cataclysm that results from our greatest fall since time
immemorial.

The title above is about the fanciest way of saying: we're all on the
tracks about to get hit by a train and no one is worried about how
we're going to get out of the car. That's the gist of this article.
There's some things coming. There are clearly people who are concered
about those problems, but there are only a handful of people concerned
about them all as they impact each other.

None of these are happening tomorrow, by the way. Calm TF down. The
economy is not going to crash. It's only going to crash if we DON'T
deal with these problems. Quite literally, if we fail to control the
transition from here, where the sky hasn't quite fallen, to there,
where the sky is and has fallen -- only then does America actually
have problems.

And if you want to say that I'm alarmist and irresponsible for writing
about this? You're irresponsible. No one sees this shit coming. When
people realize they've been lied to and the sky has fallen, they're
going to be pissed about it. The won't be as pissed if they have
something to do about it before it falls. America is not paying
attention to the right things. You've all been hypnotized by the
election and everything related to it whereby you're playing directly
into the hands of our enemies.

Get up. Stand up. And fight for your rights.

### &#8968;&#8969; [Imaging Technology and Computational Medicine Imply Trillions in Collective Liabilities From An Accurate, Irrefutable Assessment of Psychiatry's Insane Costs and Benefits](#imaging-tech-and-computational-medicine)

Novel imaging technology -- like MAS, Spect, PET, and others -- create
the possibilities of neurological forensics and stastical methods
which prove the true cause of mental illness as well as the existence
of top-secret neurological intervention. The problem? If random people
naturally discover either of these, the are some really awkward
questions that must be answered. Ain't no cigar smoking dude out there
planning on answering those questions. Get real.

Furthermore, predictive medicine, including knowledge about gene
networks, will demonstrate trillions in damage from presrcription
medication, industrial chemicals, household chemicals and food
additives. What's made this so hard to study thus far? Many of these
are not toxins individually, but only pose a threat when taken in
specific combination or sequence.

All in all, this means millions of cases where damages could be
owed. This is all revealed simultaneously and the science makes it
irrefutable. I dont know how it will play out for each specific
carcinogen or downstream prescription side-effect, but for those
detected by methods of data science, there will be no question.

There are some in medicine, industry and science who already know this
is coming, eventually. They understand the potential conferred by data
science, predictive medicine and novel imaging methods. What would you
do in their shoes? To be sure, it's not really their fault, but
they're the ones selling products that everyone knows make people
sick. Suddenly, this is revealed simultaneoulsy, within the span of
ten years in an irrefutable way. If not handled properly, it will have
catastrophic consequences on the American economy. As of now, it's not
being handled properly because people still act like it couldn't be
possible.

So, what's the plan? When are you going to hear about it on "Morning
Joe" -- you're not. Journalism? No offense, Joe, it doesn't exist
anymore. Look at what's happened to me. People have pinned everything
on me to minimize the number of people tormented for being a
messenger. That doesn't mean there are no plans to handle this. In
business, problems always present opportunity, but these unforeseen
levels of liability imply socioeconomic churn on a scale never before
seen. This simply means money, assets and businesses will change hands
from those who have profited thus far into the hands of those who will
begin to profit from the solutions.

<a name="cost-of-medical-care-and-ubi" />

### &#8968;&#8969; [Cost of Medical Care and UBI, Along With A Failing Food Supply](#cost-of-medical-care-and-ubi)

This leave America in a pretty tough spot because medical technology
is kind of our bread and butter. It's a major export and we protect it
through intellectual property. That's why our prices have always been
so high at home: we control the intellectual property. If we don't pay
an arm and leg for it here, who will? On the surface, this seems
wrong, especially to those who are dying from lack of medical
care. However, this is a major pillar of the American economy. Ever
wonder why it's so hard to get universal health care in America? THIS
is why. Take this away and you essentially declaw the american
economy.

This brings me to my next point: if we can't profit from health care,
how do we cover the cost of health care? Especially after our people
have been subjected to these levels of toxicity, which promote chronic
disease? This is why we must turn this ship around. What we've been
doing is not economically sustainable. If you don't understand the
question, it doesn't matter how you *feel* about the potential
solutions. If you don't understand that question, it means you don't
understand where government revenues come from.

I want a happy, healthy population, free from the fiscal and emotional
costs of disease. How do you get there? By turning around the
lifestyle of the American Public. This is why Michelle Obama's drive
for nutrition was so critical towards what Obama was trying to do with
health care: if you cannot lower the costs of treating chronic
disease, you cannot sustainably finance Obama's health care plans. It
infuriates me that the Republicans are trying to undo this. Truly, you
are shifting the burden of longterm healthcare costs from the
government *back to the people*. What we truly need is for healthcare
prices and expenditures to come down! Regardless of how pays for them,
that is critical! Someone has to pay for it.

Further exacerbation of medical problems can be seen in the American
food supply. Here's a challenge to put the food supply problems in
perspective: go to any grocery store in American with a single mineral
in mind, besides sodium or calcium. It could be iron, zinc, or
magnesium, which is critical for mental health. I want you to fill up
a single grocery cart with the food that it would take in a single day
to get that mineral's recommended daily intake. It's impossible. You
can't, without cheating using artificial formulations like Soilent,
supplements and vitamins. Did you know that more than 2,000 genes
cannot be activated without Vitamin D? No? Why are you talking to me
about my health?

The food supply itself and the economic advantages we gain from wheat
exports are both threatened by the looming spectre of a drought and a
Second Dust Bowl. Why? The Ogallala Aquifer is drying up. One major
consequence of climate change and global warming is that the ice and
[glaciers in the Colorado mountains will melt
faster](https://arstechnica.com/science/2018/01/many-glaciers-letting-rivers-run-low-others-are-falling-apart/). These
drain into the Ogallala acquifer, the vast reservoir without which all
great plains farmland is devoid of moisture. That's right, no
agriculture in America's breadbasket. Sound fun? NO! Right, water
utilization levels exceed their replentishment rates. Those rates of
replentishment are precisely determined by meltwater from the Rocky
Mountains. No ice? No Glaciers? NO WATER.

This is why, when I pronounced the quasi-quasi-joke-religion that I
started, I declared that the transplanar entity [Cxor Apache
Ogallala](/posts/2017-02-07-oneirontology-semiotics-karma-and-moral-consequentialism.html)
was speaking through me. It's a reference to how important this all
is: without it, prices of domestically produced food in America
skyrocket. No one even knows it's a problem. There's also a clever
math joke in the name, but it's not worth explaining.

And further still, have you considered how government and society
plays out with UBI? Every citizen that cannot work become a fiscal
liability and nothing more. What sounds like an amazing utopian
society is nothing like that at all. It is a horrible place where the
only value of human life is in what the powerful can extract from your
life before you die, since everyone on UBI contributes to a massive
net drain on government deficits. Still sound like a good idea?  Then
read [International Trends 2020:
UBI](/posts/2017-06-05-international-trends-2020-universal-basic-income.html). You

When combined with the feedback loops and vulnerabilities in machine
learning algorithms cause significant harm to society. These
algorithms have a tendency to magnify the amplitude of disruption in
systems feedback loops. This is before the impact of people is
considered. If every person has a voice with the capacity to
contribute to turbulence, which is their right to free speech in
America. However. when the media aritificially restricts the variety
of promoted topics, this limits the range of choices for people to
respond, which funnels their sociophyscial energy into that limited
set of choices. This causes magnification of energy, itself containing
downstream amplification effects, feeding back into the energy of the
topics which trend towards the top. Issues that are relevant to people
can also be divisive. When this stark contrast in opinion itself also
feeds these loops, then the divisiveness and need to dominate itself
fuels the amplification.

Intentionally harnessing feedback loops in social media to create
division in society. Adversaries of America, whose societies may not
protect free speech, stand to gain by amplifying the division voiced
online. These adversaries certainly stand to gain when we focus all of
our time and energy inwards, forgetting how to work together.

If you are in America, look around you. Who is "the enemy?" As
Americans, the enemy should not be you or I, unless either of us is
making a literal explosive device in our basements or planning a
violent act. In the first place, why are Americans the enemy here?!
It just doesn't even make sense. But do you trust a stranger on the
street? Do you trust your neighbor? Do you really trust your friends?
Your family? If not, why? Are they bad people? Or good people in a bad
situation? If it's the latter, *WHY THE HELL DOESN'T SOMEONE DO
SOMETHING ABOUT IT?!* We live in a democracy, don't we?

Much of the same medical imaging technology forms the basis of
neurological forensic methods that prove neurological interventions,
as well as both psychologically and pharmacologically-induced
connectopathies. Methods for identifying neurological interventions
will emerge within the early 2020's, especially if they trigger
systemic, cascading connectopathies. These methods will have been used
to control people.

Again, the lack of certainty for how these methods would be accounted
for and explained in the future is what's most unsettling and
foreboding. Where is no plan in place to address legal axioms that are
upturned and tableflipped by this technology, nor would such plans be
trivial. There have been many sci-fi works about blurred identity and
malleable memory, but where is this *hard sci-fi version of Rainmaker*
which closely examines the downstream legal consequences? As they'd
apply our life? What about all the catch-22's?

Does it seem like anyone plans on getting up on a podium and
explaining to Americans what has happened to our country with
psychological warfare? Again, the implementation of tactics without
the necessary recourse for correcting or even explaining them. That is
what you need to look for: lies and meticulous deceipt without the
expectation of ever telling the truth. It's everywhere.

The internet is a new age library of alexandria, except that cheap
access to digital information and cheap synchronization of information
in the cloud causes us to prefer to all store information in the
cloud, on a hard-drive or at least digitally.

When's the last time you bought a CD? OK, Lady Gaga's newest album? If

Is there any evidence left that your precious artist's last CD even
existed? Think about it. Annhilate all digital information and almost
all of those cultural artifacts over the last decade or so are
*effectively purged*, as if nearly two decades hadn't existed at
all. At least, not the way we remember them.

Our society assumes that all digital cultural artifacts will be
perpetuated forever, like their tangible artifacts. Because our
society hasn't experienced an Atlantean neo-deluge of digital culture,
it doesn't know to make strategic decisions moving forward with that
possibility in mind. In such a global-EMP or global-cyber digital
deluge scenario, the past generation would have left almost no traces
of itself behind, specifically because it's communicating primarily
through digital means and the majority artifacts of culture are
digital. In this regard, all but a handful of people in industrialized
nations are ignorant to the potential consequences. In the wake of
such a catastrophe, he void of information from this generation allow
someone to completely rewrite this period of history, if we're not
careful.

Also remember: the CD's that were not effectively shielded from beta
particles are also themselves annhilated. Ever put a CD in a microwave
for 5 seconds? It's TOAST! Why? *BETA PARTICLES*. They are literally
what cooks your food in the microwave. Almost nothing above water or
above several meters deep remains. Some good news: this could almost
certainly never occur globally.

In such a scenario with complete absence of information, the group to
power back up and pump information into that void is the group that
begins to dominate the narrative. There will be several such
groups. The ones with the greatest degree of hardened communications
equipment will be the most capable of dominating this null information
void. There are geostrategic aspects to reestablishing information
consensus after a tragedy like this. America IS ready and other
nations like China or especially Russia are also ready for these
scenarios because these three nations have enjoyed the local military
supremacy required to plan for these kinds of problems. In such a
crisis, information is almost more valuable than food or water. Most
people would rather nearly starve, when offered something that gives
them hope. What offers you hope of something better? Information.

What is vital for planning for and acting strategically in such a
scenario? Social physics. No one wants that situation. Absolutely no
one, except perhaps a handful of cigar-smoking men across the
world. However, the group who expects the unexpected stands to profit
from the unexpected. The ignorant then become like leaves in a wind
they cannot begin to see. Knowledge is power, truth is formless and
all-emcompassing and ideology is for fools who cannot think for
themselves.

#### Deconstruction is Key To Reconstruction, But Humanity Desparately Needs Order If We Are To Survive

![Kali Yuga](/img/posts/2018-01-25-caelis-ruissent-avoiding-the-engineered-collapse/kali-yuga.jpg)

More good news: while the tensions with North Korea bring the
threat-level higher than ever, the likelihood of nuclear attack
remains fairly low. However, if we do not stand against proliferation
of nuclear weapons while all these other threat levels are high, then
likelihood of nuclear attacks skyrockets. Why? More plentiful supplies
of enriched uranium litter weapons caches and energy storage across
the world. That's the far more significant danger: not that nuclear
attacks will occur when things are fairly sane and stable, but that
nukes will fall into the wrong hands after powerful states fall.

So when states like North Korea seek nuclear weapons simply because
disarmament politics are attractive, THIS MAKES ME SO INCOMPREHENSIBLY
IRATE! I cannot stand the idea of states seeking nukes simply because
they want to be talked down. It makes me incredibly angry.

Yet, Chelsea Handler -- the new age Jane Fonda -- wants you to
question everything that's happening right now, especially the
potential War on North Korea. Why? Could it be that some of the
"Americans" like that, who aren't American-first are leading the

Chelsea Handler and Jane Fonda might be dissidents, but they are
fighting on the wrong side of American interests and we will
collectively bear the consequences of their actions. I think liberals
came around pretty quickly and realized North Korea was no issue to be
trivialized as a political bargaining chip.

What about the elimination of film negatives from Hollywood via a
["mysterious" fungal virus](#)? This serves the interests of
retroactive cultural annhililation. No one even thinks about stuff
like this. I am. I see it coming. When I talk about it and I'm
therefore tormented psychologically because it must be important to
someone. The problem: I could never tell who was psychologically
tormenting me.

### &#8968;&#8969; [Some State Actors Need to Destabalize the Interantional Human Rights Regime Before the Next Global Conflict](#some-state-actors-need-to-destabalize-the-international-human-rights-regime)

What's the problem with warcrime prosecution? Why are laws so strict?
Especially under the current legal regime? The states who discover
those transgressions only want to use them for leverage because all
significantly powerful states have enough leverage on each other such
that none of them will bring suit against another in the ICC/ICJ
unless they can be sure to finish them off.

Moreover, the laws are strict to mitigate the incentivization for
covering up warcrimes, as well as the tendency to recruit others into
your plans without telling them they have committed warcrimes, until
*after* you're threatening them with their life if they don't comply
in continuing to cover up their actions. It is incredibly difficult to
prosecute warcrimes and it is unbelievable how hard it is to be taken
seriously in America, albeit my own case is "mild" for some strange
definition of mild warcrimes.

Intelligence is trade in the commodity of secrets. These secrets have
confer more power when only a few people know them. This makes it
harder for your adversary to logistically calculate their actions
because its very difficult to homogenize information across large
governmental organizations. If you know a state like Russia or China
commited mild warcrimes within their borders, it is usually more
useful for you to keep that secret and *use* it as leverage, placing
it on the board like a pawn for blocking purposes. I did not say that
either Russia or China is guilty of warcrimes. It is simply an
example.

However, convicting Bosnian leadership of warcrimes? That's
simple. There's not much of a long-game for American intervention
there. That regime was falling anyways and America needed them to fall
pretty hard. My opinion on those cases, is that prosecution was
trivial to pursue because it would be an indictment of the leadership,
not the people or the state, in particular. Further, the Bosnia
military was suppressed and didn't have nukes pointing at America.

For any sufficiently powerful state, accusations of warcrimes are met
with subversive intelligence activity to kill, maim or otherwise
silence the victims and witnesses. At least, this is what I've seen in
my own personal live, which is ludicrous, since these are *warcrimes
lite* -- warcrimes all the same, though. And you're damn straight that
I'm not going to sit idly by and be a pathetic, trembling victim of
nothing, just because the federal government is guilty as hell in my
case. You aren't doing anything. You aren't letting up. You won't even
say my fucking name. Go to hell, as far as I'm concerned.

Regardless, as dark as this sounds, there's a need to undermine the
current international human rights regime and, in deed, the
international legal and financial regimes. This seems to be part of
Putin's endgame, as far as I can see. Why? I don't know. I would
assume that Russia feels if it gets some of its teeth back, it can
make more incursions back into Eastern Europe, slowly, without
all-out-warfare. Also, that, if it does come to all out war, then they
stand to have a better chance if some of those nasty teeth don't lead
to subsequent warcrimes prosecutions.

This is why I say: throw out all the goddamn neurological warfare
tactics you have -- AND kill it with fire. Make it public, so our
enemies know they are strictly off limits and always will be. Make the
whole idea of it **verboten**. These tactics have the potential to
destabalize any large power, given access to the technology.

### &#8968;&#8969; [The Need to Cover Up Crimes And Warcrimes By All Major Powers](#the-need-to-cover-up-crimes-and-warcrimes-by-all-major-powers)

These crimes are hardly limited to one power or another. I believe all
superpowers share some level of guilt in violating sections of the
Geneva Convention, whether those violations were outright, through
some technicality or by tectonic shift in the international legal
realm. Each power's actual level of exposure to warcrimes violations
differs greatly from each other's apparently level of exposure, which
has much to do with people's incentive and ability to both access and
publish information about those regimes.

One excellent way for these powers to clear the board, so to speak, is
to attempt to erase information related to these crimes and their
plans, especially that related to the cognizance of action. However,
at least as it appears in the United States, many of these crimes are
actually vigilante in nature, using fairly sophisticated communication
protocols for obfuscation, decentralization and anonymization of
action. When things occur this way, there is no evidence left behind,
but sadly, anyone who tells you "we can stop this from happening to
you" is *lying to your face*. And if they know how it works, they know
they can't stop it, not immediately. They are trying to compel you to
cooperate to spread that liability across the population.

As mentioned above, when people were conned into these actions without
understanding they were warcrimes, then they can continue to be goaded
along to cover them up. When enough people become complicit in these
crimes, the whole thing drives itself along. This is one of the most
critical reasonings by making the penalties and prosecutions for
warcrimes are so secretive and severe!

In America, what I suspect is that many of these crimes have no
record. Proving your actions may involve darkweb transactions. It
seems to operate a bit like scalping: prove you hassled someone, get
it on video (or whatever), prove it to a connection you've never met
before IRL and get you some money. Spineless? Yes. Ignorant?
Yes. Ethical? Perhaps for national security, but then again, do you
actually know who's driving your actions or have you been conned from
the start?

An action can never be considered ethical if the actor avoids
awareness of the consequences or if they just aren't capable of
understanding how their actions effect their world. Truly, total
knowledge of consequences is impossible, however -- ideal philosophy
aside -- people who seek to avoid knowledge or understanding of their
actions can never be considered to have acted ethically. With this in
mind, in order to pursue ethical action, you can only work with strong
connections whom you trust. Otherwise, you're simply a pawn. A pawn
will never be more than a pawn. There for...

Digitized records possess inherent fallibility that may open up these
powers for warcrimes prosecution. Some states more than others, simply
because they're democracies that facilitate free exchange of
information. An all-too-specific specific example of the ironic
consequences of the idealistic pursuit of free speech.

However, if these records exist, they implies incentivization for the
unforeseen destruction of data. Depending on how widespread it is,
this may be either targeted deletion, physical destruction of
information storage devices or total systemic disruption. Furthermore,
what if every person you've ever lied to in digital communications one
day became aware of all the games you played with them. What if data's
tendancy is to become omnipresent, when individual, singular datums
are not deleted or destroyed. By omnipresent, I mean that data becomes
present everywhere, gradually losing all connection to the space or
actor that created it. Those spaces or actors could be either physical
or virtual.

Albeit untenous and untested, this idea scares the shit out of world
governments, corporations and even [career
criminals](https://www.facebook.com/dconner.pro/media_set?set=a.10204224939180327.1073741838.1732883075&type=3). What
if the NSA suddenly published every message you've ever written? What
if every digital communication you've made was used to psychologically
torture you? All while you couldn't comprehend how the data was making
itself available to your tormentors?

This idea of judgement via information omnipresence is all too similar
to the idea of "judgement at the end" that's present in the
eschatological myth so many world religions, though NOT identical. It
is irresponsible to consider it identical to "divine judgement."
However painful, we need to deal with the sins of the modern era,
otherwise we will allow the worst of us to dominate humanity for
eternity within a false paradigm.

Who is a citizen and who is not? Do legal residents have rights? do
illegal residents have rights? Of course they do, but the question is:
what subsets of rights granted to US Citizens do do legal and illegal
residents have? what subsets of rights do refugees have while they are
migrating fleeing through other countries? This is the focus of
[Nationality Law](http://www.wolfpublishers.com/book.php?id=1209), a

![International Standards on Nationality Law](/img/posts/2018-01-25-caelis-ruissent-avoiding-the-engineered-collapse/international-standards-on-nationality-law.jpg)

We are entering a period of time where the international legal regime
is changing gears and beginning to focus on transnationalism in a
transition towards the post-Westphalian paradigm of post-nationalism.
What's post-nationalism? It's a state of being for the international
regime which is post-nationstate: there are no nations, except perhaps
a dominant global government.

The particular [nationality
law](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nationality_law) issue at hand: for
non-enemy combatants, what subsets of US Citizen rights do they have?
Do they have ny rights? If they don't have the rights of US citizens,
whose laws even apply to them? Or are they people who are meant to be
hunted down mercilessly by whatever is going on in America, without
even realizing that they should run or fight back?

If that makes me

emphasis on the two exclamation points and authentic phonetics for the
English "wh". You have to exhale when you say it. We're currently
prototyping a language at the intersection of Spanish and English
vocabulary, but with Japanese grammar and Chinese Kanji. The language
could not care to be troubled with materialistic sentiments such as

The joke that the US government is building a wall to keep us in has
some very dark undertones to it. Why was the holocaust so big anyways?
Because the Nazi's didn't want people running who'd be able to live to
tell stories about the horrors they saw.  Therefore, you keep these
people in, which is why my low average annual income is evidence
supporting my case: I couldn't run if I wanted to.

I've contacted the Dutch, the Japanese, the Spanish, the French and
the Canadians about asylum, but I can't quite apply for asylum in any
of those countries because I literally don't have the money it'd take
to leave. It has nothing to do with wanting to leave. I don't want to
be here. On the other hand, if I did leave, they'd simply clamp down
around on my family and friends, who've are essentially loose ends in
all of this. There is no running from this. I must stand up for
myself. I must fight my own battles and NO ONE has a better chance of
doing it. So, if you plan on victimizing me, you're damn straight that
I'm gonna give you a case you're never going to forget. Good luck
making it to court, by the way. That is exactly the kind of challenge
that the inward-pointing barbed-wire is for on that "wall."

Don't forget, you're psychologically torturing an idiot savant whose
intelligence you miscalculated over and over again. Don't forget that
I'm a polymath, just like Imhotep, Da Vinci and others. REMEMBER THE
NAME: *DAVID CONNER*. You're never going to forget it and nothing I do
will EVER be violent, so you can go ahead and drop that non-sense. I
will not be afraid to browbeat every last person in this country to
get my way either, and you can be sure that there's not a single
person who can stop me. Put me in contact with someone whose IQ is
above 160, I dare you. They will flip to my side so fast, you'll be
arrested for warcrimes before you can even hear a damn sonic boom.
That's Mach 2.

#### They've Rue-eened My Life

If you're a IQ 80 roadblock, make fun of me for PTSD, my psychological
torture or my warcrimes accusations one more time. Demeaning someone
is a terrible way to pull them to your side, but if you actually knew
what I was saying, you would be on my side, screaming in the streets
about this because -- even if you're on the left -- they're going to
be coming for you all too soon. This is not about left or right, this
is about a Deep State conspiracy to collapse the United States and,
apparently, I'm one of the biggest threats they've ever had, which is
strange because I'm partly on their side.

Another important question of Nationality law: how long were the
non-enemy combatant (NEC) provisions in NDAA intended and architected
to last? Does it matter? YES, it does. Why is this question so
important? It belies an intent to architect everything that's
happening on the supranational/international legal stage so that it's
only transient, since it's not intended to be permanent.

If these provisions were intended to last for a decade or longer, they
should be designed to face court proceedings and not fall to pieces,
in federal courts or international courts.  When these sections of law
are tested in courts, the rulings and opinions should contribute to an
accessible body of precedent. Otherwise, you can't assert these laws
are battle-tested in courtrooms. If these laws aren't battle-tested or
no legal precedent is intended to ever accumulate, it could be because
there's something else bigger coming down the pipe, which is exactly
what everything else in this article indicates!

To all those major world powers: you're all just as guilty as one

karmic obfuscation wasn't so incredibly valuable, you wouldn't see
powerful people intentionally obfuscating their actions by working

Creating disposable, programmable "dolls" has unimaginable utility for
these people. If you don't understand the problem with that, you don't

It turns out that Lee Harvey Oswald really did kill Kennedy and acted

These conspiracies will tableflip long-held axioms about world
history, though many cannot disrupt too much. However, the story of
Columbus? That's a fantastic example of a cover story. New World?
Woops! Didn't even see it coming. Pestilence? Genocide? The death of
90% of the indiginous population? Woops! It was all an "accident."

These are the types of stories and long held bases of historical
thought that will be simultaneously upended: ALL WITHIN THE SAME
TWENTY YEAR PERIOD. This will happen across the world. It is confined
to no region, state or culture. However, the more you have invested in
these narratives being true, the more you have to lose if they are
upended and tableflipped!

The current power elite cannot allow this to happen. If they collapse
the system now or soon, the chaos acts as a cover for ALL their sins
throughout the entirety of history! It does not need to be like
this. It never did. Every person among the billions of people who
would needlessly die in such an Apocalypti-caust is a chance to help
set humanity on course in the proper direction. There is no reason for
so many people to die. We need each and every one of you.

This will accelerate while the masses are starving and thirsting for
real truth. not every narrative that will be tableflipped will occur
because the disruptive information is true. NO! Adversaries in
information warfare have never had more powerful tools at their
disposal for lie and projecting those lies across the world. It merely
needs to appear to serve the interests of the starving, impoverished
masses to be accepted as true. That this is plauasible in itself is
far more dangerous than anything I've written in this article thus
far.

That all available knowledge would become known by all can be
anticipated in ancient ages, simply by extrapolating social physics
with overpopulation. That all fabricated stories would fall to tatters
and that all would be judged for the lies of history would also be
knowable. I am not blindly asserting this. I would love to debate the
merits of that statement.

about it in my series [International Trends

a series composed of 20,000 of purely unintelligable bullshit, as far
as I can tell. I'm basically a homeless Michael Crichton, so how
would I know?

One of the most fascinating aspects of law is **circumplexo corpus**,
though I'm not sure I've found the proper Latin translation. It is
very likely that there's already a latin phrase to describe this -- I
just don't know about it in my abject solitary confinement. This term
describes the body of law and systems of law that surrounds the body
of law that you practice. Some systems of law are bottom up. This is
considering systems of law from the top-down.

Yes, there is an intellectual property endgame. Intellectual property
and copyrights are specified as "inequalities" in legalspace. That is,
they cover ranges of information, not specific instances of
information. This is very important because it implies that the space
can be completely covered, especially once STEM starts to accelerate
as we approach the Singularity.

These assertions are debatable, but because patents and intellectual
property. A component of the geopolitical strategy of the Chinese and
Russians will very likely be to disrupt all intellectual property when
the international legal regime is disrupted, as if they haven't
already stepped on our intellectual property enough. There's no
question about it. They WILL do this. You can set your watch by that.

The question I'm asking about it is: do our "leaders" even see this
coming and *what have they planned on doing about it?* Why the fuck do
they continue tormenting me, when I know ALL of this? Or is it because
they plan on *using* all of this and can't have people knowing what's
going to happen? They partially justify the complete blackout of these
questions by claiming they want to "discourage a panic" -- but I say,
we want to encourage actual strategy, not psuedo-democratic
demagoguery and kangaroo elections.

### &#8968;&#8969; [The Economy Will Collapse Within Two Decades And ALL Socioeconomic Flux And Churn Begins To Align *IN PHASE*](#the-economy-will-collapse-within-two-decades)

The US Government is like a hot potato ... for politicians. Not for
me. Go ahead and hand that thing over to a real visionary, if you want
to avert or solve this upcoming fiasco. I propose rule by loosely
bi/partisan [Thirty
Tyrants](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thirty_Tyrants) and a clear
demarction into martial law social institutions whose authority is
dictated by the needs of FEMA emergency government plans, when these
problems begin until these issues are resolved. It's hardly an
original idea.

Everything discussed thus far has merely been a potential catalyst for
economic collapse. The greatest economic collapse yet to experienced
in history has been preordained by technology, exponential population
growth, unrestrained connectivity and unrestrained acceleration in
information bandwidth. It's inevitable: when this socioeconomic churn
aligns in phase, it increases in magnitude, which contributes to
wealth disparity. When population grows exponentially, so do
individuals contribution to the magnitude as well as the per capita
measure of that disparity.

Once viewed in this light, it has literally nothing to do with the
actions or strategy of some [executive branch
politician](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Presidents_of_the_United_States). What
do the American people want? Do they really want to hear more about
whose fault it is? That's what the media thought, when they marketed
this kangaroo election.

This is knowable in the time that the eschatology of major religions
was being written down, which is why most of them contain prophecies
of economic collapse, resulting in starvation and mass chaos. This
isn't too different than the prophecies that Moses delivered to
Pharoah, actually. In my opinion, those things that happened were
knowable by a highly intelligent man who knew his land better than the
ruler of the day, depending on whether you tolerate more liberal
interpretations of the bible. The truth is, of course, the lower-class
workers often do know the land and its phenomena better than the
rulers, who can't see for shit from their ivory towers.

You have to understand social physics and the geospectral aspects of
socioeconomic flux. If you understand this, you can know that the
biggest collapse ever is yet to come. I don't know when and God help
us all when it does. It is actually far more possible to undrestand
this in ancient times than it is now.

Sociophysical dynamics ride on top of the Mandala phenomenon from
[Kautilya’s Mandala
Theory](http://rjhssonline.com/HTMLPaper.aspx?Journal=Research%20Journal%20of%20Humanities%20and%20Social%20Sciences;PID=2012-3-1-32),
where modernization, rapid transportation and *lightning*-fast
communication have lead to the total expansion of all spheres of
influence: the ideal maximization of this phenomenon the expansion of
Mandela-spheres is that everyone is everyone's neighbor, but also that
everyone is everyone's 2&deg; neighbor as well. It is from these
rapidly expanding Mandala-spheres that socioeconomic flux also aligns
in phase. *Churn* is the transition from one pole of a wave of
socioeconomic flux to the others and understanding how to capitalize
on that by methodically extracting slices of churn is the Crème de la
Crème of billionaires. The greater these fluctuations become, the more
likely they are to become in phase, and thus, the hidden magnitude
from spectral decoherence is removed. One does not cannot stop these
economic contractions. You have to figure out how to mitigate them.

#### Dear America: I may be a failure, but it's what you wanted and worked so hard for, isn't it?

This results inverse of the spheres of influence that Kautilya
discusses in Mandala theory. This results in a kind of "internalized
externalization" of these sociophysical spheres of influence at the
end modernization, culminating in the Singularity, but nothing ever
truly ends.

#### [Emulation of Ancient Thought Confers Penultimate Metacognition](/posts/2017-10-30-speed-of-thought-sociophysical-postulates-1-to-11.html#emulation-of-ancient-thought-penultimate-metacognition)

Why? Because times were simpler, the range of phenomena were much more
constricted than they are in the modern are and, crucially, knowledge
of social physics as it relates to socioeconomic flux was more natural
and less virtualized then. Modernization has given rise to false,
artificial economic phenomena that result in very real opportunities
to profit, but are far less stable in the long term.

You need to read what Nassir Tebar has written on tail risk and
understand me when i say that cataclysmic tail risk event is
UNSTOPPABLE. it must exist because of the global economy's exigent
sociophysical phenomena -- both mechanics and dynamics. there is no
way to eliminate it because of social physics. it is like the event
that balances everything else. in a system with spectral or
geospectral mechanics, for every ebb, there is flow.

Give me a liberal that runs away from any debate with me on economics
and I'll show you a ostrich with its head in the ground. This is NOT
liberal or conservative; it's something taht we are all going to have
to deal with. The consequences, whenever this happens, will be
catastrophic. We can structure the economy to prevent the effects of
spillover, but this is not "spillover" because it is a spectral
phenomenon where all socioeconomic churn begins to align in phase. The
"geographic" aspect of it begins to melt away and all regions begin to
experience more turbulence than ever.

#### BIS Paper on [Macroprudential Policy](https://www.bis.org/publ/bppdf/bispap86.htm), That Friend Who Is A little Too Enthusiastic About The Rules

We all have one of those friends, right? Sometimes he's an asshole and
he'll turn you in for breaking the rules "because he cares about you."
But then, it turns out that he was right and you didn't realize it
until a few years later, so you make up with him because he was the
only one who told you what you needed to hear. That's kind of what
macroprudential policy is like for central banks, if cheap credit is a
drug problem. The metaphor breaks down thought: macroprudential policy
is both good and it's bad. It's going to lead to some hurt feelings
though, when some nation's central bank has its treasury bond issuance
chilled and can't dig itself out of a crisis with more debt.

Although I am incredibly skeptical of such tight economic regulations,
macroprudential mechanisms will help reduce the severity of some
turbulence. However, if these are not properly tuned, they may
contribute to disparity in how the spillover effects play out, which
leads to finger-pointing as some people will be hit harder and
penalized more than others. America is one such nation where we may be
lead to believe in the future that we were screwed by macroprudential
policy. The truth is that we were screwed by a runaway dependency on
debt, but when you stop this, it has consequences. No one wants to
touch the free-credit firehose. Yet, the other side has arguments too:
Keynesian economics allows you to capitalize on opportunities
faster. However, the cheap credit means the myopic and poorly informed
misallocate your investment in what resembles a hacked system. Those
same poorly informed people simply end up fattening the power elite,
who reap what they sow.

That this may be inevitable, I believe that the authors of eschatology
**may** have known. This is because all religions were obsessed with
prophecy fueled by social physics. If you read religious texts in
certain ways -- and I'm hardly a man with a true understanding of
theology or an understanding of any single religion -- but it becomes
clear that these people foresaw things using methods, the outlines of
which most of us can barely grasp.

### &#8968;&#8969; [Severe Turbulence in Forex Markets May End Up In Nations Making Accusations Of Wealth Incineration](#severe-turbulence-in-forex-markets)

One frequently cited component of marxist rhetoric that I cannot stand
is the notion that we can simply do away with money. It's an insane
and deluded argument that marxists find themselves overly dependent
on. The world would be a better place if this idea just went away. I'm
not trying to be mean. Just realistic.

To all the communists who say: in the future we'll eliminate money. in
the future, energy IS money. Joules become dollars, you ironically
overgrown Marxist cumstains. Drown in your own ignorance if you'd
like, but the rest of us are trying to save ourselves and we don't
need your pseudo-economic gurgling. Stop gurgling and drown: the world
would be so much better off if your sardonically materialistic
philosophy never existed.

The notion that we could have a society without money is bizarre, yet
I hear it all the time. No man is an island and no economy is an
island. Even if your economy has no concept of money, it still needs
to trade with other people and other economies. What is money? Yes,
money is an abstraction; it’s a virtual commodity that stands as a
placeholder for truly valuable commodities. But what is money? What is
its essential role in society?

Money represents society’s ability to quantify resources and trade. It
is essential to quantification of commerce and of needs for human
life. You cannot have a well-functioning society without money. As
technology progresses in the 21st century, we will find that the
ultimate resource to quantify is energy. Accumulated energy is the
potential to do work, in the physical world and the informational
realm. Energy will replace money, but it is still something that needs
to be quantified and accumulated. There is no 22nd century society
without a need for quantification of resources and/or energy.
Therefore, society will always need something like money.

Forex destabalization isn't that bad. However, the renewables market
and international climate control policy is only part of the
problem. The labor markets, the geographic disparity in automation's
contribution to the lack thereof, speculation on Wall Street and
unwisely warranted derivatives further exacerbate currency
destabalization.

Calm the fuck down. We have Bitcoin and no one's destabalizing
that. It is quantum resistent ... After publishing this I think you'll
find that some Bitcoin traders will need a new pair of pants. Its
... uhh essentially good for the Bitcoin market, eventually.

So, the role that money provides eventually transitions into
energy. Money actually represents one form of sociophysical potential
energy: the potential to influence the decisions of others.
Interestingly, spending money usually has physical effects on the
world: people begin making different decisions. When you follow such
metaphors too closely, you end up soundly like a sociopath, so keep
that in mind. However, when the role that money plays in society
instead becomes occupied by energy, this has interesting implications.

Now that we can agree that money is never going away -- because it
eventually transitions into energy -- then as this transition plays
out across the currency markets, large evaporations and diffusions of
wealth may preordain, foreshadow, or initiate conflict between
nations, regions, groups and people. Indeed, we will always experience
conflict over resources and this is a partial basis for conflict
theory, a sensible group of ideas put forth by Marx, which is saying a
lot, coming from me.

#### Investing With The Holy Spirit!

That was one of the most eye-opening lectures I ever watched on
international finance. This is why I give everyone a chance. I try to
listen, no matter who I'm talking to. I know it's hard to understand
me sometimes. That guy? Genius. I'm not sure I can recommend his fund
for investments, but he definitely knows his stuff. You're about to
disover what it means to live under the thumb of an alternative truly
exploitative international financial regime to which we are forever
enslaved. You are idiots. if and when this comes to pass, you will
truly understand how your far-left belligerence was **TREASON**.

Follow the money -- or at least follow the future incentivization
structures -- and it leads to the Chinese and their novel
interantional world order du jour: BRICS/AIIB/NDB/CIPS (BANC). BANC is
yet another system whose outlines are in place, which indicates the
orchestration of sophisticated plots against America. Furthermore,
Their CIPS payment system allows terrorists to subvert wester
anti-terrorism laws that protect us against terror groups utilizing
wire-transfer. In general, asians have an incentive to work together,
but the Japanese do not want to become subservient to the Chinese.

This BANC *must* be the exigent destination of China's endgame.
They've already bet on this horse until the end: all roads will lead
to BANC, if they don't already. Dominance over international finance
-- and simply moderate influence over it -- confers unimanginable
power.

My own opinions with regard to this scenario come after coming to
understand decades of Chinese contempt and antagonism with regard to
intellectual property, like copyrights, patents and even military
trade secrets. I understand what they're getting at. They simply do
not enforce these international norm within their own borders and
steal so much from Western interests. They assume that we'll never
know what goes on behind closed borders. It all goes back to many of
the philosophical underpinnings of Marxism, by the way, but Communism
has actually worked well for the Chinese. The development they've
acheived over the past six decades is amazing. However, communism will
not work so well in America.

They've weakened us by copying and stealing our patented technology.
They've stolen our military trade-secret technology, which they will
use to manufacture competitive military products they plan on selling
to the satellite states within their sphere of influence.  They plan
on beating us with our own military technology. They've poisoned our
children with melanin. They've shipped Fentanyl to America. They're
putting pressure in Pakistan and even the Khyber Pass in Afganistan,
in anticipation to dominate the Heroin market to fund black ops
worldwide. They've led us astray by using the greed of our wealthiest
as a weapon.

If my intuition serves me right, this will essentially be the same as
getting trapped with high-debt during a deflationary crisis,
especially if debts become rewritten in terms of a Bitcoin/dollar
exchange rate at a low dollar value. They're about to make fools of
all Americans, who will become their debt-slaves forever in an
international finance and monetery scheme rigged so that Americans can
never escape debt.

Regardless, we're not going to let this happen. That's not to say that
Americans aren't willing to work with the Chinese, but we are not
fools. We must work together with China. We do not want to be your
enemy, but your plans are fairly simple to understand. However, we are
not going to fight a war because that's insane ... or is it?

No, this will quickly become a cold conflict, which will play out
similarly to the first Cold War. Our victory will be predicated
through expansion via authentically symbiotic Foreign Domestic
Investment and other economic/poltical means. Towards authentically
symbiotic fiscal relationships, America has more to offer *because of
our diversity and connectedness* than China could ever dream of.

This is why Americans must focus outwards and not inwards. Everything
about the election and your obsessive focus on the results has been a
carefully laid trap, though I am so censured on Facebook and Twitter
newsfeed algorithms, no one could possibly hear what I have to say
through all the weight of my algorithmic demerit points. Thanks a lot.

China, in the coming years, we will not need your industrial
capacity. No one will because that's the trend that emerges as
fabrication technology becomes available. This is not accounted for in
explanations proffered by economics professors because they don't yet
understand how fab-tech challenges previously held axioms of
economics. Therefore, China, you cannot depend on nations needing your
attractively cheap, burgeoning industrial capacity, so if you're
calculating your geopolitcal moves with that, think again.

America and the western world is essentially at the same economic
crossroads that Europe was at between WW1 and WW2. Furthermore, we are

Data science will show who stands to gain from the fall of America. We
can methodically identify who has postured themselves to this end. You
will support American financial interests or we will destroy you. And
please, we want your support. Do not posture your financial interests
against America. It is foolish because, regardless of how this plays
out, you will lose if America falls. There is simply no other way.

#### If you are European, DO NOT bet against America.

It is NOT in your interests. You may be pleasantly amused at the
American kangaroo election, but that is all by design. It's a
distraction. If even five of these things come to pass, who will be
there to stand for your defense? What will become of NATO then? Europe
will fall because Europe has become weak, which is the only point
Trump was trying to make about NATO during the election. How did the
media spin that?

The 2008 financial collapse harnessed the fractures of aligned Jingo
tower of derivatives and debt. It may at least be seen as an
catastrophic accident of unrestrained, unregulated greed. In the
context of this scheme for the international financial regime to
change hands, how does that play out for Europe and American allies?
It doesn't, does it? Let me ask you one more time: IT DOESN'T, DOES
IT? We just need to be sure, so get in line and get ready to follow or
at least get out of the way.

That economic forces we cannot control introduce potential
incentivization for depopulation is just another ravine in the
metaphysical leylines contributing downward pressure rapidly
accelerate towards several of the scenarios outlined in this
article. Truly understanding much of Nassir Taleb's work on convexity
and concavity of systems will help in deciphering the previous
statement. What we're fighting against is not human. It's basically
fate, which has presented us with social life exhibiting alarming
concavities to avoid and essential convexities to use as
tools. Concavities pull you away from regions of stabalization.
Convexities provide "leylines" that focus entropy against all odds,
yielding enthalpy that focuses reality into certain forms.

#### The Folding Funnel Demonstrates how Enthalpy Guides Protein Folding

![Entropy vs. Enthalpy](/img/posts/2018-01-25-caelis-ruissent-avoiding-the-engineered-collapse/folding-funnel-enthalpy.jpg)

Understanding the webs of paths -- the webs of worldlines -- that move
us towards this set of predestined or preordained points is key to
understanding the best path forward. If you have a materialist
conception of metaphysics, you are inherently challenged in
understanding the phenomena unfolding in front of you for anything
except what they **appear** to be. However, nothing is simply what it
is. Everything you can hold, every idea you've had has a story of
where it came from, stories for each fiber or piece of the object,
stories for how that idea translated itself into action and
transformed the world.

#### The Analogy of Leylines Illustrates the Shape that Guides the Potential "Worldlines"

![Protein Folding and Metaphysical Leylines](/img/posts/2018-01-25-caelis-ruissent-avoiding-the-engineered-collapse/folding-funnel-destructured-paths.jpg)

Given the same set of information, the "classical" materialist can
only see the potential for divergence. Revising their understandings
of the world, adjusting for the clearly improbably, then they begin to
see the possibility for the invisible hand, for intelligent design and
for everything else that they cannot explain. This is because their
worldview only permits them to see systems as chaotic and divergent,
where there is no inherent similarity between configurations: no
symmetry of all things.

They are very intelligent, but they are wrong. Furthermore, there are
some among them who *do understand*, but want all the other moderately
intelligent people to only believe materialistic conceptions of the
world -- not for the sake of rationalism and science, but for the sake
of profit. These materialistic heretics in sheeps clothing see the
truth, but they do not want you to see the truth because confusion,
discord and ignorance lowers total profit, by optimizing the diffusion
of profit. From your misunderstanding of critical axioms, you never
see what's right in front of you the whole time and you always
miscalculating via *divergent* extrapolation, since *convergent*
extrapolation is not a tool available to you. The people who stand to
profit most from this are the ones who see it most clearly and hide it
themselves, but work hardest to spread this misunderstanding.
Understanding this means nothing if you do not have the social
standing and wealth to posture yourself markets, so that you
anticipate what no one else sees.

### The Wheel of Time And it's Sinosoidal Ouroborosian Symbology

![The Wheel of Time](/img/posts/2018-01-25-caelis-ruissent-avoiding-the-engineered-collapse/wheel-of-time.jpg)

Greed to control economic and financial imperatives of the 3rd
millenia may encourage a handful of us to act against humanity's own
best interests.

This is not to say that Oil companies will push us in this
direction. In the past ten years, I've seen a lot of change from
corporate America that indicates promising change in direction and I
hope that it indicates a change in prevailing attitudes.

You can't win if you try to fight economics head on or ignore it
entirely. you have to use economics, but remember that your
stewardship of wealth must be used for the advancement of all
mankind. if you do not excercise your stewardship over that weatlh
with that in mind -- and truly, with that altruistic desire to advance
mankind with your wealth -- then someone else who better exemplifies
this should seize your wealth.

It is not the money that matters. money comes and money goes. if you
bury it underground for 100 years, you might as well not have it. To
me, money represents stored potential energy offered by vast wealth --
this is potential energy for change. We must use it, but the groups
with the clearest and most righteous vision for how it should be used
for change should be in control of it.

This set of beliefs is motivated by my understanding of Aristotle's
virtues and of stoicism, a personally beloved system of philosophy. I
am a stoic at heart. What matters to me is not your name, your place
at birth, your family, your degree, or anything like that. I don't
care if you are Marcus Aurelius or Epictetus. I care what motivates
your actions, that you know why you do what you do, that you care to
learn as much as you can about the world, that you work as hard as you
can to move those around you forward, and that you are willing to
suffer for what you believe in. Any aristocracy without adherence to
stoic principles is not a just aristocracy, in the original sense of
the term.

To be sure, I am impressed by many of the changes i've seen in the
rich over the past ten years, but taken aback by the total absence of
acknowledgement of this from the left. We must continue moving in the
correct direction. I also believe that total collapse might be the
worst possible direction, especially since many of the forces we are
battling with were always fated and simply are what they are,
regardless of who is in charge. I'm worried that sociocultural
destablization presented by technology and especially social media
hack the systems of government and communication that have served
America and the world so well for so long. This threatens everything.

#### That Said... Peak Everything Forever

There are many crackpot conspiracies out there for depopulation.
However, if you understand how to ride the hockeystick tail of
high-demand resources, while profiting along the way, then you'll
understand that you can manipulate the supply of goods to create
artificial scarcity and profit more, for longer. However, when these
good are in high-demand, but supply is just inherently limited, then
only by limiting consumption can you leverage what is essentially the
same tactic. This is how you profit maximally from goods whose supply
is and has always been inherently limited by their geographic
distribution and mechanisms of creation. This brings us to [Conflict
Theory](/posts/2016-10-12-cosmic-disruption-of-conflict-theory.html)

Quite soon, the supply chains of many industries will shrivel up as
novel fabrication technologies are introduced. This results in a
second industrial revolution. It changes everything you though you
knew about macro and micro economics or industrialization or economic
development. If you have a degree in economics and you hate Trump,
you're probably wrong. That's what you just don't get. Not everything
follows the rules. What is critical is identifying the exceptions to
the rules. I don't have all the economic experience to know that I'm
100% correct, but I know that I'm looking at something about economics
that well-educated people just won't let themselves consider. And it
changes everything. FOREVER!

I'm not trying to chastise people on a political basis simply for
missing some key inferences. I'm trying to say: have an open mind
instead of jumping on the anti-Trump demolition train. You don't know
what you need to know to have the opinions you so fervently amplify
with all your copycats retweets and shares. One moderately educated
person person with *original* thoughts is worth all the retweets and
shares of 10,000 highly educated people who are deafeningly voiceing
the planted opinions of others. That's without considering whether
those thoughts are also novel in addition to being original. There's a
huge difference.

#### Peak Autism: Is The End Really Nigh?

![Peak Autism](/img/posts/2018-01-25-caelis-ruissent-avoiding-the-engineered-collapse/peak-autism.jpg)

For the uberelite, the problem is not access to supply, nor is it
exponential increases in demand, nor is it inconsistent fluctuations
in demand.

If rates of consumtion are too high, how do you adjust the economic
externalities -- which are NOT externalities for the elite. at first
glance, this seems to be equivalent to demand, but it's not. it's
demand when adjusted for population and the upward pressure that
population has on price over time. In other words, the powerful would
like to extend peak-X forever, but they can only do so by limiting
consumption.

*AS IT APPEARS IN 2018* -- the problem is consumption. However, this
is a terrible assumption. Taken to the extreme, not only does it waste
the potential of human life, it's short-sighted and myopic. The bases
on which this assumption is built will change, as technology like
fabrication expand the known range of possibilities. Don't ever let
yourself form axiomatic assumptions about the Singularity! Always be
ready to reticulate everything! The key to the Singularity is to
maximize flexibility, action and the potential for both at any
time. Yet another paradox. Oh joy.

This brings me to some interesting correlations between renewable
energy, cryptocurrency currency mining and data flows --
e.g. Canadians mining bitcoin in Romania. In some cases, it may be
more efficient (or profitable) to use excess renewables to mine
cryptocurrency or facillitate ethereum operations than to store or
transport it, however cheap that might be.

This might give rise to novel types of financial flows that would
essentially be bundled as assets or derivatives. **Is every greedy
Marxist going to steal this idea too?** You're essentially betting
that crypto activity will be more profitable than selling/storing the
electricity -- either now or in the future. Eventually, investments
could be bundled or facilitated as novel types of crypto futures,
among other creative derivatives.

These derivatives differ starkly from the "Bitcoin futures" of
today. They also depend on your capacity and need to store energy. If
you run out of local energy storage or if energy transfer
infrastructure is overloaded/disrupted, then the best option is almost
always crypto mining or ethereum. This could lead to shady finance
schemes not yet seen, whereby profits are accrued and financial hopes
dashed through the discouragement and manipulation of the architecture
or development of both energy storage and infrastructure in countries
across the world. If there is less infrastructure, generally, than
it's easier to influence to short the derivatives mentioned
above.

#### Math == Money

It's like measuring the influence that removing small numbers of nodes
in algebraic graph theory has on [qualitative and quantitatie
metrics](https://reference.wolfram.com/language/guide/GraphMeasures.html)
for that graph -- i.e. the qualities of delta-metrics, for the minimum
and maximum vertex cuts on graphs when considered algebraically. The
more connected the graph is and the more nodes there are, generally,
the less potential for disruption there is when a small number of
nodes are randomly removed. Control the development of infrastructure
and generally increase the potential for profit via the structure of
nodes on the "graph" of energy infrastructure.

Again, steal all my ideas. I don't actually care. Most of them aren't
exactly novel and I'm not sure why I'm thus tormented for writing
about them. I have so many that my mind itself is considered a global
security threat, apparently... But the volunteer social media
therapist(s) remind me of how delusional I am. I think I should listen
to them, and look the other why while I'm tormented and all my ideas
are stolen. Isn't that wonderful? Your [communist vigilante
psychiatrists] and ensured that all you crypto-Leninist shitdicks have
to deal with the consequences for fucking me in the ass all this
time. Apparently, what comes out of my mind isn't so worthless and
delusional as you'd prefer for my family, friends and everyone else in
the world to believe.

#### Please Not The Heavy Utilization of Baseless Assumptions and Leaps to Conclusions in the Following Paragraph...

Fiat currencies were old, even in the days of the Romans. Every empire
that rises and falls begins to gravitate towards fiat currency because
to relieve associated with fluctuations in value and especially the
regional availability of currency. When the regional availability of
currency fluctuates, the economic flucations create the impression in
the poor that the leaders don't know what they're doing. Fiat currency
allows you to direct the expansion of currency regionally and
generally. It's use is justified, but fiat has the potential to create
unimaginable power for the self-enrichment of a select few. It has
always been this way and the überelite can't help but gravitate
towards that source of power, whoever they are. It happens in every
major civilization because fiat is an unfortunate necessity for
economic stablity.

By the time America was established, the point at which fiat currency
would be needed could likely be *measured*, with some assumptions on
flexibility to control the expansion of the fiat currency, such that
the destination point where the currency could no longer be stable
would also be known. IMO, this is probably close to the point at which
the penny becomes worthless or at least literally worth less than the
copper it was minted with.

I believe that the founders intensely studied empire, democracy and
history before the founding of the Republic for at least 50 years
while they plotted the revolution. The growth of population was
measurable. I'm *assuming* that the approximate time at which fiat
would be needed or wanted could be *known*, at least given
multifarious methods for influencing it's adoption and rate of
expansion. So, it's a good guess, combined with an understanding of
how to turn that guess into reality and adjust the plans as needed
along the course of 250 years. *IF* this is what happened, kudos to
the founders. That is impressive!

#### I Keep Saying "Emulation of Ancient Thought Confers Penultimate Metacognition" and Even If I'm Wrong, I'm Smarter For The Thought Experiment

Honestly, even though this sounds a little crazy and is not provable,
if I'm correct about all this -- which I know a few things about
America that Senators and Presidents don't even know. If this was the
way American history and finance was planned to unfold, it was kept
secret for a reason. However, what is certain is that empires rise and
fall much faster in the modern era. The founders would undoubtedly
realize this trend: that, were America to become an empire, because of
acceleration in population growth, it's lifespan would be somewhat
shorter than that of the British Empire. A new empire at this point in
history would last less than 40 years, if it weren't for the
Singularity, *which changes everything*. That's what is different this
time.

Thankfully, because of the Singularity, the world will eventually move
away from fiat currency entirely. When and how this this happens is
uncertain. Also: I could be wrong; I am known to be wrong quite
often. However, I'm not afraid to be wrong because my tenure doesn't
depend on it and I sure as shit don't have a job that does. Instead
those people are afraid to give me the chance to prove almost any of
my ideas. Derision is cheap. I'm used to it.

What I'm saying: something big is coming; America is at a major
crossroads; there's two main paths leading away from here. One leads
to economic ruin and subservience while we rot in the hell of the
anti-American narrative that our enemies worked so hard to create. The
other leads away from that, towards sustained prosperity and, quite
possibly, for eternity.

What I do know about power: DO NOT LOSE IT, whether this is the power
of an individual or a group. When you enjoyed a high degree of
influence and have wielded your power wisely, you've done things that
gradually persuade your enemies join in a chorus, creating a narrative
that blames *you* for *their problems*, despite the fact that most of
these problems were a cost of doing business for people in power. When
you lose power, they will do exactly the same thing, but the first
thing your enemies will do is destroy you with that narrative they've
created. If America loses power, it's not going to be pretty. So
instead of protesting the next war while ironically complaining about
people creating prosperity on Wall Street -- and quite often
developing a criminal level of greed -- we'd be alot better served if
you'd go briefly *Occupy* a recruitment office.

We are rapidly losing the military-technological edge that gives us
the deterrence that counterintuitively leads to peace. When we lose
the economy, we will lose the ability to fight a war. Bringing about
the revolution you've wanted to for so long will only bring this
nation to its knees. You will lose all your social programs along with

You set yourself free with the truth. I'm not encouraging immediate
action here. Since I've written about things like economic collapse,
that may cause panic, even though I've stated: almost none of this is
going to happen within the next decade. Furthermore, you can
guarantee: if there's a systemic problem with the world economy and
the right, powerful people know about it, they will seek to fix that
as fast as they possibly can. Sometimes you can count on their greed.

Instead, I want to encourage caching information in indestructable
forms so that the people who *may be architecting* this have to fear
the consequences when they realize that none of their duplicitous
manipulations will work. The Dead Sea scrolls were hidden for two
millenia, but if they had ever been found before the modern era, we
would *NEVER* know what we do today. That is the appropriate response
to these Deep State Actors. Let them assume command of this situation,
while being terrified that, if they don't work as hard as they can to
hold Spaceship Earth together, the whole world will know the truth,
despite what happens in between. That's kinda what makes them tick
anyways. They already operate under the assumption that everyone will
tear them apart if they fail.

Let them know: they can't hide the truth forever. And let humanity
work as diligently and as intelligently *and as swiftly* as possible.
We need the combined energy of everyone. We cannot waste what each and
every one of us can contribute.

And so how do you stop this? By caching this information and by making
it as permanent as possible, even if you have to print it out,
laminate it and bury on the Appalachain Trail. No plan like these
could ever succeed ad infinitum without all of the architect's
meticulous constructions falling on top of them if the people around
the world know what actually happened and could not ever
forget. Furthermore, we may find that we cannot destroy information
relevant to the preservation of a false narrative, which is why so
many long-held truths of history may find themselves overturned.
Science may be able to prove otherwise, even though we don't know at
the time that information relevent to overturning those narratives
will be proveable.

This is why people who fear God usually try their hardest to do the
right thing: they believe God is watching everything they do and knows
everything they think. So there's nothing they could get away with if
they tried. Instead, their behavior is constrained to what is
permitted by their belief system and they do not need to understand
how they will be judged, but simply that they will be judged. Still,
the truth is not always so simple: in order to understand what you
believe you have to spend your entire life learning about your belief
system and learning about life. If you ever stop learning about life,
your beliefs and the people around you, you'll never truly understand.

#### ... And I Hope You Activate the Potential For Every Person To Be As Great As Any Of Us Could Ever Be

Instead, almost everyone just wants to shoot the messenger. The one
with the message you need to hear. What you need to hear is NOT what
you want to hear! Deal with it because this is real. It's not going
away: it hasn't come to pass yet, but it will. When it happens, you

These shadowy powers that be are the people that have moderately
controlled the evolution of language. They have have architected
history: the pattern of myths that establish the base paradigms of our
collective narratives for explaining who we are and how we got to
where we are. Regardless of where we live, we all have a collective
story for how we got there and this narrative motivates our
actions. Stories in history are like patterns for sewing clothes: each
one provides a convenient basis by which we compare not only heroes,
pariahs and demagogues, but ourselves and each other.

The truth is, the individual that I am has revealed almost nothing
that was always preordained to be revealed at the end.

What does the illuminati do to people they detest? They freeze them in
carbonite, so to speak. If you actually manage to make waves, you
become frozen into history after death, completely unable to control
the evolution of your narrative, which is partially what men fear so
much that makes the idea of heaven so appealing. Regardless of whether
it's real or not, heaven is an idea of the place you spend for
eternity, if you only believed in the vision of Jesus Christ. It the
idea itself at least has power. Men fear how their stories will play
out after their lives, since they'd have no power against their
enemies to sew them into narratives and dominate the tellings of their
stories.

*In my own interpretation*, those who rot in hell are forgotten
because, to the church, these people did not stand for what was
critical: the collective, geopoltical self-defense of Europe or its
expansion into the New World -- in addition to the values systems of
Christianity, of course. Those who ascend to heaven are instead
preserved, but collectively coupled to the image of Jesus Christ
forever. This is a magnificent fate, compared to the obliviation of
Hell.

Hell is not always a literal obliviation. If you piss off people who
are powerful enough, your image and identity will wander for eternity,
forming the basis of a pattern for a story in which you are hardly the
hero. Instead you are the fool or the pawn who is to be hated and
detested for eternity, whose story is to be propagated by the occult
as long as possible. See why I might be a little pissed off? Who
stands to defend themselves most, after death? Those with the social
and financial resources to set in motion plans which carry themselves
out.

Obviously, the potential for damage to have been done is incalculable.
However, we are positioned to root out people who are using government
as a tool for their own self interests as well as those who would see
America burn in economic ruin if BANC ever came to be. Best of all,
against all odds and despite our starkly contrasting current reality,
the American people are more ready than ever to come together. It
might not seem this way now. However, given the right course of events
and given that enough people in our country choose self-preservation
and patriotism over petty ideological arguments -- we are truly closer
than ever in being united at the most critical time in history. The
right set of actions must come to pass, serving as a keystone to unite
the American people, so that we can focus our energy outwards, instead
of succumbing to domestic tensions. We must do this or we
fail. Another lesson we must learn: never give up.

There are rumors of false flag attacks or economic collapse triggering
martial law. Neither of those are likely to occur at the moment. The
event you should be worried about is not something to fear, but a
period through which to proceed with caution. It is a great awakening,
where people acknowledge what is happening, some people are targeted
as having attempted architecting the economic demise of America, and
there is some tension that plays out as a result of the division we've
seen in the last 10 or so years.  Fortunately, when people actually
wake up to what's happened, it will be a catalyst to America's benefit
because it must be -- otherwise failure and csacading collapse is
assured.

For the far-leftist opposition, their leadership will collapse: the
less visible leadership of "architects" who has indirectly been acting
behind the scenes will no longer stand behind a movement which is not
"in vogue" ... Instead they will seek to get out of the way as fast as
possible like the rats they are. Again, for the leftists behind the
scenes *designing* the implementation of this "community" action --
i.e. all the passive aggressive toxicty of our cities and all the
indirect targeting of citizens -- that less-visible half of their
leadership will disappear because they don't want to be left holding
the bag. These are the people that are going to be hard to find, but
these are the ones who need to be punished.

The more public half will be left holding the bag. These are the
elected representatives and more visible, public community leaders who
were lead by their intent to improve their lives, but deceived into
harming America. While this segment of leadership may be more visible,
it's more important to convert them and win their support, while
testing the authenticity of their change in action. Once the average
person realizes what has happened, even if they are moderate leftists,
they will come running as this catalyst for awakening rips through
their movement. The radicals will simply be running scared and will
not seek attention.

When people in the public all realize what just *ALMOST* happened,
then you can guarantee that they will support the side who serves
their best interests. And that is the American side, not Republican or
Democrat or Conservative or Liberal. When the public at large realizes
that the archtected economic collapse certainly meant that the bottom
would fall out, the poor would have had it worse than ever AND they
had been strung along by deceitful radicals the whole time: you can
count on their support. Simply relate to them that no economy means no
benefits, no welfare, no medical care, no coverage and that these
architects *wanted* that, but that the people who intended that were
*not* the public leaders they looked up to.

Then, a small portion of their leftist movement will be left to be
cannibalized by itself, so the new right-center can be sure none of
these most radical architects want to stick their necks out for a
while. Again, it's a period of time where caution must be exercised
and it will certainly be a little chaotic.

How do I know this? Once the *TRUTH* is in place, then the architects'
precious anti-bourgeoisie narrative is destroyed *AND CAN NEVER BE
RECOVERED*.

Just like how the stage was set before Napolean fired those fateful
blasts of grapeshot, the American people are sick of seeing these
Robespierrian witchhunts. In the French Revolution, you first had the
Jacobins, who plotted to overthrow the monarch. Then, Robespierre went
nuts with the guillotine. Finally Napolean steps in and only a handful
of people tried to stop him. Why? In post-revolutionary France, people
were sick of the revolutionaries' abuses of power, but they hated the
monarchs more and never wanted them to regain power either. Napolean,
basically a complete nobody at that point, enters stage left and
becomes the hero, giving the people the compromise between the
*nouveau pouvoir de l'inexpérimenté*, who only understood rule through
fear, and the *ancien pouvoir*, who methodically suppressed the poor
for so long.

![The Arc de Triomphe on Champs-Élysées](/img/posts/2018-01-25-caelis-ruissent-avoiding-the-engineered-collapse/arc-de-triomphe.jpg)

Subsequently, Napoleon then gets drunk on his own success and embarks
on a roadtrip to Russia, establishing the seeds of the French-Russian
socialism connection that would begin to morph into Marxism some half
a century later. This is perhaps his *greatest* mistake because in his
conquest of Europe, Napoleon essentially scatters a diaspora of French
cultural seeds, which all act as a basis for a high degree of
sociophysical connection for the next century.

When Napoleon first gained power, what was Napolean armed with?
Knowledge of the truth that seems to have completely eluded the
Jacobins: the struggle of the poor was moreso linked to economic
circumstances, perhaps neglected by the crown. Nothing the Jacobins
were doing would have fixed this because they were focused inward and
determined to ruthlessly quell the chaos, wasting most of the energy
they directed through their own power structures. What they needed was
outward economic empire. The military was the best way to deliver this
in the early 19th century, which is what Napolean delivered with
outright empire.

Military expansion today won't do America much good today. It's too
expensive, today AND tomorrow. Instead we need to focus on building an
economic powerhouse to compete abroad, constructing an empire of
economic expansion via the establishment of platforms for renewables
and data science, the gold of the 21st century. We can't slack off on
military concerns, but we do need deterrence and we might just have to
fight for our rights and prospertiy.

We all know it's bad. We're ready for something different. Now that
their retro-narrative is destroyed -- the one justifying future
cultural revolution -- and they thus have no incentive to act: they
would simply bring everything falling on top of them after gaining
power *because they will know that the public will find out and
there's nothing they can do about it* It sounds crazy, but any of them
that act at this point, they will surely will be seen as traitors.

So instead they will come fleeing to our side. I swear to God that's
what will happen. I think you've heard "Be ready for them, with open
arms." We only need to find the ones who were without a doubt aligned
against american interests. We do not seek to punish or villify those
who only wanted to support the poor and struggling, but those who
would sacrifice the economy for a deceptive gambit to gain power.

So make the right information contagious: the information that
guarentees that humanity will work together. More than anything, these
überelite illuminati fear the contagion of information that disrupts
their meticulous calculations, whose moral consequentialist ends are
maintained as vague at best and unknown to nearly all. That is by
design.

This is why anyone who stands against them will be tested, then
humiliated publicly, but only if they manage to make it far enough to
be a thorn in some banking family's side. <spit/> At the same time,
this person will be stripped of their identity. Like a traitor in
Dante's 9th Circle of Hell, their head will be encased in a block of
ICE and they shall be buried alive, upside down. Not even memory of
