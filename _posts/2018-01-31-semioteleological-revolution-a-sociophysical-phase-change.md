The illuminati is like the Anti-Santa. Nope, the Anti-Santa is not
Jesus and you're going to wish it was.

### [What if Santa Clause Snuck In Your House, Stole All Your Cookies and Set Your House on Fire?](#what-if-santa-burnt-your-house-down)

Why call them the Anti-Santa? You start off believing they're not
real, but once you become about 30 years old, it's impossible to not
believe in them if you're not clueless. When you believe in them, if
you're good, they being you lots of coal. If you're real bad, they'll
bring you presents and then use your sins to destroy you later. They
don't come down your chimney, they sneak in your house and close the
flue, but only if you're worth the effort to cover their tracks. The
Illuminati almost never directly does *anything* because invisibility
is paramount: you can fight what you believe exists.

There is no one group though, why is partially why it's so easy to
forget they couldn't possibly not exist. The Illuminati is more of a
manifestation of evil that projects itself into the world through the
collective unconscious exigencies of the nature of power combined with
certain aspects of the human condition.

# [What Does Metaphysics Have To Do With The Illuminati, Anyways?](#what-does-metaphysics-have-to-do-with-the-illuminati)

Furthermore, if you're trapped with the false paradigm of metaphysics
that ascends primarily from the material, you can never actually
believe they exist, rationally, which is why that false paradigm is
soo convenient to the Illuminati. This is partially why western
cultures will often present the opposite paradigm as heresy: because
if you believe in idealistic metaphysics, you actually can see what is
happening around you. If you don't, you're simply a powerless consumer
feeding the rich. This is yet another reason why Marxism is precisely
its own antithesis.  Marxism is not liberating, it is enslaving.

Idealistic metaphysics has its own problems, but new age voodoo is
easy enough to dismiss with a healthy dose of rationalism. Another
serious problem is that, once you sociologically extrapolate it, the
after the order du jour is established, your place in society is
almost entirely determined by your place at birth and the
sociophysical circumstances that surround you. If that such world
order or state order serves the people well, this is a very good
thing. If it does not, it can end up being horrible. As long as the
social contract must be upheld, the people are likely being served
well by their state. However, a well established order extrapolated
from idealistic metaphysics is difficult to disrupt.

What is an example of such an order? Japan. It is an incredibly strong
society with a rich culture and an incredibly strong sense of shared
identity, where even the language reflects this understanding of
metaphysics. It was only possible for Japan to develop all of this
because it was geographically isolated from the mainland, but China
shares many of these same qualities. Taoism and Shinto provide
interesting reflection on these ideas.

Therefore, there's not much chance for revolution and progress in the
class struggle without sociometaphysical churn: you need both. You
must *use* both the idealistically and materially derived
conceptualizations of metaphysics. Yet, the stability of a society is
incredibly important, so if the philosophical underpinnings of your
language, culture and state are not acceptably stable and strong, you
will not have a stable society.

They are basically the same process starting from opposite ends, in a
way. If I had to choose, what would I prefer? Idealistic metaphysics
because it is the truth and the truth sets you free. But some truths
are created and in themselves only are derived from happenings in the
material world: history. Of course history is truth that you must deal
with, but it is not THE Truth. The Truth is everywhere: it is timeless
and spaceless. The Truth echoes from beyond the material world and it
determines the course of all phenomena through fate.

- what is sociometaphysical churn and is this the proper term?
  - sociophysical flux/churn could be defined as changes in how
    groups/regions of people understand the world through belief
    systems and epistemological structures.
  - (1) churn of social consequences mainly resulting from how
    epistemological structures are rooted in either the idealistic or
    ideal conceptions of the metaphsyical
  - (2) and in how whether the knowledge structures are primarily
    constructed from additive logic ("pure rationalism"), subtractive
    logic ("i only know for sure the set of things that is
    impossible") or a combination of both
    - how to methodologically combine both additive/subtractive
      epistemological structures to congeal information using
      statistical methods (analysis of information graphs and
      information networks)
      - this process allows you to cyclically reiterate the
        information/knowledge graph where you use
        additive/subtractive/consensus methods, augmented by
        statistical analysis of the network, to expand the graph and
        determine your level of confidence of information
      - using this idea as the basis of an algorithm that optimally(?)
        expands the information/knowledge graph by directing the
        computation energy & time or by directing the acquisition of
        knowledge

- sociometaphysical churn:
  - how people's conceptions of society reinforce or diffuse the
    "clarity" of potential futures
    - so, with idealistic conceptions of metaphysics, the
      metatypological components of possible futures congeal into a
      set of more clearly defined, convergent possible futures.
      - because these possible futures have converged into a
        profoundly smaller set of possibilities, it becomes much
        easier to extrapolate and understand the paths foward from the
        present into the future.
    - people who have a materialistic conception of metaphysics tend
      to ignore many of the components of the future which are assumed
      to be exigent, pre-ordained or necessary.
      - instead, they focus on the divergent paths forward, only
        accepting what is in front of them. they focus on the power of
        choice that they have to change their lives. (ignorance is
        bliss)
      - individuals determine their own fates based on what each
        individual believes about the world, therefore which
        conception of metaphysics they choose, if any, to base their
        worldview upon dictates how they view their own reality and
        the range of what is possible.
        - each individual's understanding of how free will might
          affect their life depends on whether the paths available in
          their worldview are primarily convergent via idealistic
          metaphysics or divergent via materialistic metaphysics
      - when you zoom out to greater sociological scales, (this
        phenomonon) determines how groups of people view the range of
        paths available and whether they are free from the chains of
        fate.
    - for better or worse, people who accept their fate can be trapped
      within a idealistic reality that is detached from their
      individual capacity.
      - when groups of people believe that their fates are sealed,
        each individual is much less likely to act against authority
        for their own benefit or to join a group of people.
        - (video of that one girl dancing at a festival, and suddenly
          many people start dancing)
      - when groups of people believe the idea that their fates might
        be sealed is ludicrous, they will never simply fall in
        line. they will always struggle forwards and work hard to
        change their circumstances because they believe that their own
        actions matter.
        - this descends from the belief that their world is defined
          from what they make it, instead of being defined by a
          restricted set of convergent paths leading toward potential
          futures.
  - there is social flux and churn to this "sociometaphysical"
    phenomenon. every region, group of people and individual is unique
    in how they view the world. there is always change to how people
    see the world and in the types of lenses through which they know
    to see the world
    - this social flux/churn was seen in the 20th century, from the
      buildup to WW2 and throughout the Cold War. Marxist ideology
      needs [people to believe in] the materialistic conception to
      disrupt old ideologies and to cause the potential for a
      "universal" worldview to emerge: on ostensibly based on science.
      - Communists promise a utopia free of economics where a dominant
        worldview based only on rationalism and science stamps
        everything out.
      - in practice, the worldview that the Party promotes is poisoned
        by Marxism's own flaws, its need to rewrite history, its need
        to use STEM as mechanisms of control, and its need to control
        "truth" to advance its agenda.
    - this social flux/churn also resulted from the explosion of
      rationalism and science: people who understand the world through
      the lens of science are usually in the materialistic camp.
      - people have been arguing about this for millenia, but (science
        drove this viewpoint forward)

  - this "sociometaphysical" flux/churn results in expansions and
    contractions in the sociophysical possibility space, as it appears
    to individuals of all classes and creeds.
    - how you view the world defines how you see the range of options
      for action in the world.
    - when everyone believes the (same thing), this enables people in
      power. when people's belief systems are unpredictable and
      typologically incoherent, this results in informational spectral
      discord:
      - power structures are likely to change,
      - people in power make mistakes as previously held assumptions
        no longer hold true
      - but most critically: people are much less predictable


- the social/individual components of an individual's
  belief/knowledge/information system
  - religion is a social belief system, but it is acquired gradually

# [Who Are The Illuminati And Why Are They Such Assholes Anyways?](#who-are-the-illuminati-and-why-are-they-such-assholes-anyways)

So ... No, the Illuminati is not one group and that's worse! because
you can't so easily destroy them without either becoming them or
having another group swoop in to fill in the power vacuum. if you
don't accept this, you have no business trying to fight them because
you'll probably just make things worse.

![Magus Summoning Lavos](/img/posts/2018-01-22-semioteleological-revolution/magus-summons-lavos.jpg)

The Illuminati, in is various incarnations, has been destroyed time
and time again, only to be reborn. They view themselves as necessary
evil *and they hate themselves for it*. That's important to rememeber,
since these psychotic assholes view love and hate to be identical
phenomena, essentially. They don't play fair and they push against
themselves to make themselves stronger, viewing the strongest, most
pure, most cunning as being the rightful de facto leaders in their own
invisible, decentralized power structures.

### [How Can Pindar Lead an Anonymous, Decentralized Group Of Cigar-Smoking Men?](#how-can-pindar-lead-an-anonymous-decentralized-group-of-cigar-smoking-men)

Why is "Pindar" their leader? Because Pindar's vision and authenticity
is unparalleled. They are constantly looking for the person that has
what they do not. Pindar is not a single person, per se. Pindar only
derives his authority from his resistance to their flame, but they do
not know who Pindar is because they are looking for the person who can
see what they do not. And the Illuminati have meticulously crafted
mechanisms for ensuring the properly networked architecture of
society, all decentralized and autonomous. It is outlined similarly to
the sheaf and the reaper, the merchant of souls.

#### The Illuminati Is Speculated By Some to Have Three *Branches*

![La Mort et Le Fossoyeur](/img/posts/2018-01-22-semioteleological-revolution/la-mort-et-le-fossoyeur.jpg)

So, they cannot recognize Pindar, but because they seek to so tightly
control the prevaling narratives, myths and especially history, they
hate this person. He is the blinding one who tells stories they cannot
understand and writes truths which cannot so easily be perceived.
Those stories slip through their minds' grasp; he is the one who slips
through their cracks, all the while blinding everyone around him. They
hate him, but they need him because he can see what they cannot -- yet
a person like this can never be given power in their understanding of
the world.

<a name="the-sword-in-the-stone" />

# [What Was The Sword in the Stone?](#the-sword-in-the-stone)

The illuminati have crafted myth and legend, narratives of heroes
which are meant to play out generation after generation, that function
to establish filters that cause the virtuous, righteous and
intelligent to sift higher into society, so that their society is as
strong as possible. The sword in the stone is such a myth, probably
crafted by Merlin -- or the unknown historical Merlin. While perhaps
not a myth of this mysteriously vague Illuminati, it is fascinating
all the same.

Merlin was the classic wizard: someone who wove together the fates of
men from the shadows of the ostensibly greater men; someone who defied
common comprehension and still does, 1,500 years later.

#### John Dee - [Mona's Hieroglyphica](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monas_Hieroglyphica), the Hieroglyphic Monad

### [A Myth To Test The Mettle and Steel of the Ideal King](#a-myth-to-test-the-mettle-and-steel-of-the-ideal-king)

While the role of monarchs has waned in the modern era, such tests are
still incalculably valuable for determining who deserves to lead by
determining who has the sharpest vision, the most unyielding mettle,
and an unquenchable resolve. Today, the power of myth itself is
waning.

How does the Sword in the Stone sow the seeds of leadership across the
British Isles? If Merlin created the challenge, why could he not solve
the Sword in the Stone himself and become king? Who would follow him
if he had? Morever, the long-term objectives of this myth seem to be
in creating not just one leader, it galvanized many strong men and
while they all developed strength, few of them developed the actual
traits required to release the sword.

<a name="this-kings-selection-myth-as-a-sociophysical-protocol" />

### [This King's Selection Myth Was A Sociophysical Protocol](#this-kings-selection-myth-as-a-sociophysical-protocol)

Why could the myth not begin and end with Merlin: someone had to spead
the myth. Behind the scenes, people had to acknowledge this leader as
King of Britain. In this way, the myth of the Sword in the Stone was
like a protocol for selecting King's Candidates.

On one end of this myth and protocol, you have all the common people
and their children struggling to elect themselves king by sheer feat
of strength. Yet, no such brute force could ever unsheeve this
sword. it didn't matter how physically strong you were: that was not
the king that Britain needed. However, this challenge brought many to
test their strength against the stone.

On the other side of the protocol, you had crazy ol' Merlin roaming
the land, trying to get tribal leaders to agree to become oathbound in
following whoever pulled the Sword in the Stone. In consenting to such
a hypothetical agreement, these leaders perhaps thought they'd swore
to follow a king they assumed would never exist: they believed that no
man could ever exist that would accomplish such impossible feat of
strength. It was proposterous. They'd send men to inspect the actual
sword in the stone, which generates sociophysical flux towards a
central point in the land. This is no doubt a clue to the original
location of such a sword, if any of my theories hold up. This is why
social physics is so fascinating: it's a fresh lens on many mysteries
that we perhaps thought lost to the sands of time.

This leadership-selection protocol to work, there were two main
sociophysical mechanisms at play. The first is obvious: the magnetic
allure to draw men to a central point of Britain to attempt to draw
the sword. The more impossible the challenge seemed, the more magnetic
it became. The second sociophysical mechanism was much harder to see:
Merlin had to convince or swindle the informal, de facto leaders to
agree to follow the champion who solved this riddle. Without people's
tacit or explicit agreement to follow the future King Arthur, anyone
could pull the sword from the stone and simply be a looney leader with
no followers.

<a name="the-galvanization-of-the-strongest-leader" />

### [The Galvanization Of The Ideal Leader(s)](#the-galvanization-of-the-strongest-leader)

So, who was the ideal king that Merlin was searching for to lead
Britain? There's the obvious leader, who everyone would follow, but
that individual wasn't the only leader Merlin wanted to create. Merlin
needed to generate high volumes of sociophysical flux: chatter to
drive people to become leaders in and of themselves. The common people
would need to talk about becoming stronger and why it was preposterous
for anyone to follow the eventual yet-to-be King Arthur. What was a
leader to them? That is the conception they needed to form in their
minds, followed by the action the most perseverent among them would
surely take to become the strongest individuals they could be.

![Arthur, the Undefeatable King, Exclaims "EXCALIBER!"](/img/posts/2018-01-22-semioteleological-revolution/saber-undefeatable-king.jpg)

This is social engineering at its finest: the methods were not forced,
but if these theories hold up, these methods would have been
effective. If Merlin truly wanted to catalyze the social development
of Britain, one leader cannot do that alone, regardless of what sword
he wields. A leader is nothing without followers and a strong leader
is nothing without strong leaders to follow him or her. Power
structures are hierarchical. The power you wield derives from the
people to whom you could signal; it can be measured by the level of
influence you can exert over 2&deg; and 3&deg; social neighborhoods,
although "influence" itself is a bit hard to quantify.

<a name="arthur-the-unlikely-but-certain-hero" />

### [Arthur, The Unlikely, But Certain Hero](#arthur-the-unlikely-but-certain-hero)

So, again, who was the ideal king that Merlin wanted? Someone who was
young and innocent, but heroic and incredibly intelligent. Why young
and innocent? Because someone who was not burdened by the karmic
weight of information attributed to their actions was free to lead how
they felt best and wouldn't be burdened by the weight actions using
others. Since they were young and unknown, those mistakes could be
expected to be few and far between, as would be the informational
reverberations of those mistakes throughout society. There would
simply be no information about them that others could use to slowly
assail the leadership or abruptly tear them down. Why an intelligent
hero? If the were intelligent enough to solve the sword in the stone,
they could be best molded into the perfect leader for the early
British Isles.

<a name="the-karmic-consequences-of-power-a-sociophysical-paradox" />

### [The Karmic Consequences of Power: A Sociophysical Paradox](#the-karmic-consequences-of-power-a-sociophysical-paradox)

Sociophysical paradox of karma and power: once you have power, you use
it. Even if you use power justly, you will create enemies:

#### &#x2605; The power hungry who seek to leap frog you.

#### &#x2605; The self-indulged of higher disposition, who seek to use you as a benchmark for the demonstration of their own status.

#### &#x2605; The petty who seek to pull you down because they have no hope themselves.

#### &#x2605; Those you use unjustly may retaliate justly if you cannot justify yourself.

#### &#x2605; Those who see their service as not serving their own ends may lash out as well.

#### &#x2605; Those fickle-minded people who can be stirred up by wormtongues, lilliputians or demagoguery.

#### &#x2605; And finally, there are your true enemies, who stand firmly in the way of your objectives and always will.

There is a cost to every action you take. You have to step along the
right path, all along. The more publicly your actions are seen, the
greater the multiplicity of their consequences along the way.
Regardless of the truth of your actions, the tragedy is that it's the
appearance of your actions which defines how people will see you. Most
people simply don't have the time to reconsider what they already
know, so if a leader accumulates the karmic burden of mistakes along
the way or if a Rube Goldberg publicity machine multiplies the karmic
consequences of the few mistakes they make, there is nothing within
this physical universe that can undo that. This is what defamation and
poison pen do to someone: it's what happened to me.

As for the tribal leaders Merlin managed to persuade, if any of them
understood specifically why Merlin's king's candidate was ideal, then
some of them capable of solving the sword in the stone may have
avoided claiming kingship. Others who understood the secrets may have
leapt right for it, but insomuch only clearly marked themselves as
lusting for power.

These is the key to why the Sword in the Stone was so genius: Britain
didn't need another king to rule by brute force, but instead needed
the ideal king. So, it encouraged people to search for the ideal king,
instead of fighting themselves to claim that right by brute force. In
this way, one preemptively quashes the systemic sociological carnage
associated with eternal conflict, where one brute topples another who
topples another, each of whom merely sow the seeds for the next
conflict. Instead, the ideal king is chosen behind whom all tribal
leaders can invest their best energies and posture themselves
outwards, not inwards.

<a name="how-do-you-pull-the-sword-from-the-stone" />

### [How Did Arthur Pull The Sword From The Stone?](#how-do-you-pull-the-sword-from-the-stone)

How do you solve the Sword in the Stone? It's a puzzle about
thermodynamics that involves the Roman secrets of concrete. To make
this sword, you must know the secrets of concrete. To solve the
puzzle, one must know that iron is far more thermally conductive than
concrete. Crtitically, one must know that the sword's volume deforms
as a result of heat and, that if heat and cold are repetively applied,
the structure of the surrounding concrete cannot tolerate this and
cracks, requiring no strength at all.  If Romans ever used rebar in
their concrete, this only strengthens my hypothesis that the game
involved knowledge of Roman concrete.

If King Arthur ever existed, he likely spent his youth as a
blacksmith's apprentice. Knowledge of blacksmithing also translates
into knowledge of casting weaponry as well as the logistics and cost
structures therein. That knowledge is therefore critical for kings,
generals and ambitious knights through the Medieval era. You wouldn't
be familiar with the financial, labor, and materials costs to set a
firm defense nor could you be confident in your offense and military
logistics.

The ideal time to apply this process is well after everyone across the
land has given up on solving it, otherwise people will steal the idea
you are using to break the sword free, defeating the entire purpose of
the King's selection game. Moreoever, if it's not clear that thousands
of men have tested their mettle and failed, than none of them would
have acceped the one who did pull the sword. Therefore, if not enough
time has passed, then solving the King's selection game is
meaningless.

### [Social Physics: It's the Secret Sauce of Legends](#social-physics-its-the-secret-sauce-of-legends)

What else is incredibly similar to thermodynamics? Social physics.
People behave as particles, heat can be channeled and entropy
matters. This is much easier to observe in the macroscopic behavior of
people than it is in the phenomena of matter. If you believe, as I do,
that people who intuitively understand some phenomena must have
neurological circuits which correspond to analytic approximations of
those phenomenon, then the person who understands intuitively
understands thermodynamics can develop a powerful understanding of
social physics.

Further, if also you believe, as I do, that people intuitively
understood many of the secrets of math behind science far earlier than
relevated by the prophets of rationalism, then men may have
intuitively understood statistical mechanics, entropy, thermodynamics,
quantum field theory before they had any reason to smash atoms
together. That is, at least those concepts apply to social physics at
the 10,000ft level.

There is far too much baseless conjecture in the explanations above
for any of it to be taken as fact. Still, if you avoid thinking about
any of this on the basis that it's not factual, you're missing the
point. It's the journey, not the destination. However, the critical
point is that mathematic models behind social physics are all
algorithms based on generalized methods for quantum physics. Ancient
people could not run these algorithms. Instead, they could only
develop an intuition for the same methods without understanding the
underlying math, *per se*. Furthermore, this knowledge was always
esoteric and as prized as the story behind the mythical [Egyptian
Emerald Tablets] implies.

Without being able to quantify any data, it seems that men were better
at constructing event-driven sociophysical handlers, not unlike the
user-interface handlers `onClick()` and `onDocumentReady()` in
javascript. Particularly, this ability to imagine and design
pseudo-quantifiable sociophysical protocols seems to be the skill that
distinguished the transgenerational leaders of empires from the
leaders of minor powers quickly subdued by their neighbors. You *can*
quantify the number of types of extremely rare events that occur,
though in the extreme, this resembles soothsaying and quickly becomes
meaningless. Being capable of measuring anything like this requires
particularly stable myth as well as extensive, dependable
communication networks, who are able to process this data and relay
important events, without necessarily knowing why.

Sound like a leap to conclusions that your traditional schizophrenic
makes by inferrring the presence of arbitrary semio-linguistic
connections *that don't exist*? Ok, that's fair because it does sound
crazy. However you can, forget that linguistic connection because it's
stupid, arbitrary and trivial. Instead, read this excerpt from an
abstract on the subject.[^matroid-algorithm-computational-oracles]

#### From: [Complexity of Matroid Property Algorithms](https://doi.org/10.1137/0211014)

> A general theorem is proved which can be used to show that **for a
> large number of matroid properties there is no good algorithm of a

It means that algorithms requiring matroids are NOT computationally
friendly. Matroids eat all your energy. Algorithmic oracles, like
[padding
oracles](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Padding_oracle_attack), exist
as helpful shortcuts that can be leveraged to assert whether your
computations are proceeding in the correct direction or your algorithm
needs to take an entirely different direction.

If you don't understand, what that means is that America has gangraped
an Einstein on the floor of a train to Dashau. I should have a job. I
should be very, very successful. Instead, I'm expected to fucking work
at a McDonald's. Not only do I understand the 1,000 ft view of the
above, I can extrapolate the consequences phenomenologically and
sociologically. Someone else already did. This isn't a great example,
but when I independently uncover something that someone else has
already discovered -- *in public academia* -- then I am humiliated for
it, while being degraded, emotionally tormented and psychological
tortured in front of others:

#### I never get taken seriously in a very public way to encourage other people less knowledgable from ever taking me seriously.

### I never get job offers; any career that doesn't involve asking people "Do you want fries with that?" has been prematurely terminated.

#### And above all else, I never get social interaction with people who know what i'm talking about. That is a very high priority for people who want to keep me down.

- Why is this particular connection to matroids useful?
  - connect matroids to financial trading algorithms and sociophysical
    algorithms.

### Computational Hardness And (Inherent Leveraging) of Linguisitc Duplicity Means The Illuminati's Codes are Algorithmically Identifiable


- this was always going to happen
  - regardless of which secret society you consider, they all leverage
    morphemic duplicity to hide codes
  - there are many means of encoding information into text, speech,
    literature and language
    - almost none of these are sufficiently hard to be algorithmically
      secure.
    - one of the things i mentioned to Tatiana was the potential to
      algorithmically resolve ALL of the codes leveraged in

- almost all these codes are mostly insecure, which is why these
  groups intentionally spread them around so the multiplicity obscures
  their origin, enabling plausible deniability
- almost all the methods behind these codes are rankable in hardness.
  - it is preordained by the existance of the Singularity and the
    nature of unrestrained computation that these codes can and will
    be resolved in every sufficiently advanced society
    - around ... welll right the fuck now.

- connect these to (?)

- another reason why the argument over material origination of ideas
  and ideal origination of ideas is so important.
  - if ideas originate materially, this means that if the originator
    discloses them to someone, they can force that person to adhere to
    specific obligations, formally or even contractually. this is like
    what you sign your soul over for.
  - however, if ideas originate or congeal to the immaterial, it means
    that anyone can be the originator of either some or all ideas on
    their own by the force of sheer thought.
    - that is, your mind can find reach any idea if it is simply
      intelligent enough, which is a fantastic reason for these
      "illuminated ones" to identify intelligence early, so they can
      spoonfeed you simple information you would otherwise identify
      yourself, but bind your soul contractually for the rest of your
      life.
  - the truth is that all ideas at least cohere to or map to ideas
    that first originate from the ideal. otherwise, if this were not
    so, one could not reasonably make assumptions about other
    sufficiently advanced civilizations because every civilization
    would have its own specific divergent development. this is simply
    not true.
    - enthalpy is what causes the physical instantiations of
      materially metaphysical information to bind to and cohere to
      information which is purely immaterial -- it is timeless and
      spaceless.
      - in spite of the random, chaotic diffusion of high entropy,
        enthalpy encourages information to cohere to the immaterial,
        against all apparent odds.
      - if this were not the case, one could not expect the folding
        funnel hypothesis to hold up.

Apparently überpowerful people -- -- have an unnatural phobia of
illicit philosophy. More than anything else, they are scared of people
who think in new and different ways because peoples who are different
can't be predicted. Thus, sociologically constrain the typology &
metatypological aspects of psychology -- perhaps by introducing
artificial belief systems, however contemptuously you may hold them --
and people become like special dolls with meta/types imbued onto them
via Alchemy, like Manakin Skywalker right here.

#### Manakin Skywalker Does Airflares

![Manakin Skywalker Does Airflares](/img/posts/2018-01-22-semioteleological-revolution/manakin-skywalker.jpg)

What does this imply for the computability of past, current and future
past social physics, in a future with unrestrained quantum computing?
If the myriad psychosocial meta/typology of sociophysical entities is
profoundly more expansive, doesn't that make it harder to predict and
control people? What does that mean in the future? Considered from
this basis alone -- *future sociophysical computation* -- it is
fascinating to think about the phenomenological consequences: is it
good or bad for people to be unique?

### Dark Ruler

![Just Dark Ruler](/img/posts/2018-01-22-semioteleological-revolution/)


There's hardly anything unique about this process of the evokation of
the combination of meta/typological psychosocial fragments within a
person. This process has been reinstantiated & reiterated & combinated
through the ages. Information warfare is competitive symbology where
the victors understand the evolutionary dynamics & actually had the
social/financial resources to play.

Überpowerful people generally cannot stand someone who encourages
people to think in unpredictable ways. This vastly expands the
sociophysical gamespace. They already have control. Why do they need
you? They rather wait it out and play it safe. You cannot be permitted
to enjoy success, fame or even a modicum of attention why you're
working with such magickal witchcraft as *novel ideas*. Those are
dangerous. Instead these elite would much rather watch as you quietly
flail in agony, so they can completely control the destiny of your
image after you die, sucking you dry while you live with no one around
to help you. This allows them to maintain control of your ideas,
preventing them from spreading,giving the überelite the time and space
they desparately need to react strategically to unprecented GENIUS.
This is why every living successful artist is probably a fraud and
every wildly successful artist has been dead for a generation before
anyone ever "discovered" him.

![Hammer and Sickle](/img/posts/2018-01-22-semioteleological-revolution/)

These same people are relieved that humanity is becoming weak and more
predictable, even though to society at large, technology appears to be
doing the opposite. That is false: humanity is becoming weaker than
ever before because we are losing the ability to semeoteleologically
reproduce.

"Semioteleological" -- what does that word even mean? I invented it. I
checked. I have screenshots from google proving that no other person
EVER thought to use that word because no one has thought of
metatypological aspects of sociology so methodologically.

It perfectly describes why symbols whose meaning was so obvious for so
long have suddenly and nearly completely lost all their relevance to
humanity. thus, we are becoming completely disconnected from the myths
which helped inculcate the values systems via teleology. This will be
disastrous because we understand the world through symbology encoded
into language and myth. When that semioteleology is sufficiently
disrupted without anything to replace it, people don't relate to the
world, nor can they relate to each other.

We *think* that technology and science are all we need, but we are
wrong. We think that we no longer need religion or myth, but we are
sooo wrong. We have never needed it more.

The problem here is that every group who promises revolution ends up
being the same as those they quelled. Usually, at best, it's par for
the course. After considering the social carnage accompanying
revolution, it just doesn't leave the leaders of revolution with much
ground to stand on, morally. This is not always true, but it is very
difficult to justify a disruption in the (leadership/authority in a
society).

- three families close to the japanese emperor for hundreds of years
  - how this served the best interests of the japanese culture
    - before, during and after the time of Nobunaga
  - the emporer had the best interests of the state and the people in
    mind. to serve him was to serve the best interests of everyone.
    - but in order for the emperor and the state to serve the people,
      they had to be connected to the people.
    - over the course of generations, those close to the emperor, the
      families closest to his estate and to the government could
      "move" closer to the emperor by proving themselves
      - this is how it worked with most if not all monarchies, but
        it's interesting how well it worked in Japan, since that
        monarchy has lasted so long. It also lasted a very long time
        in Iran, so it'd be equally interesting to explore there.
      - this dynamic of moving closer and further from the monarch by
        having one's service/character assessed seems to have resulted
        in the system being architected around this.
        - japan also had very tight control of their culture. being
          east-most and geographically separate, they had less inward
          informational sociophysical flux than most, so this made it
          slightly easier to do so.
        - (it seems that this tight control of culture can be seen in
          Shinto, which is a religion that's not meant for people
          outside of japan AFAIK)
      - further, idealistic metaphysics is encoded into their
        language, grammar and thus culture. (see the particle "no")
        - this may cause the Japanese people to think about things
          differently, especially when compared to cultures speaking
          western languages, where there is so much emphasis on
          quantity, possession and the material.

#### The Dalai Lama As A Metaphysical Dynasty

- The mantle of the Dalai Lama is passed from one generation to
  another. The child to become the Dalai Lama must be identified by
  the Panchan Lama and initiated properly, otherwise he is *not* the
  Dalai Lama. China kidnapped the child identified to become the
  Panchan Lama. This means that this could not have been properly
  initated himself by the current Dalai Lama. If you believe this
  child is capable of identifying a true Dalai Lama in the next
  generation, you are a fool and know nothing of Tibetan traditions.

- How is this a unique dynasty? How is it a good selection of
  leadership for Tibet? To me, this is what is most intriguing about
  the position of Dalai Lama as the highest role of authority in
  Tibet.
  - I am speaking without knowing, but from what I perceive...
  - The Tibetan dynasty offers continual renewal without the conflict
    of revolution. It is presumed that the leader will not be
    concerned with any succession except a succession of the
    reincarnation of ideas. The meticulous reincarnation of the ideal
    values system for their leader.

- If the Panchan Lama is not initiated properly, the Lama lineage
  itself is threatened, but perhaps all is not lost. I don't want to
  explain precisely why.
  - this search for the next leader is not the work of one person or
    simply the people who surround him.


- what reincarnated or reborn beings would be useful to identify
  - for metatypological identification of reborn beings, is it

The rapid acceleration towards the singularity means that any
prevalent myths in society are diffusing their power. In America,
these myths include historical figures like Martin Luther King Jr.,
stories of religious figures like Jesus, stories of ancestors, the war
stories of relatives, and even comics or anime. They all form a
arborescent semioteleological basis. As this basis becomes varied,
fragmented, out-competed, out-moded and begins to evolve divergently,
it becomes very difficult to empathize and sympathize with each
other. As a leader, crafting a message that invokes these patterns of
symbols becomes nearly impossible and you cannot predict how people
will respond.

us predict how someone's going to respond. We can't have civil

deafening pace, resulting in all-out sociocultural chaos where all
groups step on the toes of all other groups as they imitate each
other's tactics and attempt to rebind the symbols' meanings as quickly
as possible within their own followers. Instead of actually doing
anything productive for anyone, the ear-splitting roar of fake news
vuvuzelas only serves to make everyone question everyting and
especially the truth, since it sounds as insane as any one of these
vuvuzelas.

### [So That's The Problem. What's The Solution?](#so-thats-the-problem-whats-the-solution)

For America, all of this *informational discord* makes it incredibly
difficult just to resist the chaos and succumb to internal social
conflict, not to mention all the other unspeakable consequences.

The answer is to reinforce old traditions and build a new tradition at
the same time. To all Americans, we need to harmonize our voices and
harmonize our desires to counter the spectral nature of the
informational discord. As we begin to approach the Singularity, the
information economics that exacerbate this discord are going to get
worse, unless there is an artificial push to counter them.

So, we need to figure out how to strengthen those semioteleological
roots for our ascent towards the Singularity. We need myth that is
capable of riding this cosmic space pony into orbit, but not just any
singular myth. It needs to be capable of harnessing the
phenomenological evolution of society, particularly with regard to how
technology affects teleology.

Oh, you thought this steaming spaghetti-fest of hysterical
pseudo-scientific speculation was over? Wrong. I leave you with this
one question.
