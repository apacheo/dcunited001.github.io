most radiant truth who commands the masses, if they can just be heard.

The illuminati is like the Anti-Santa. Nope, the Anti-Santa is not
Jesus and you're going to wish it was.

### [What if Santa Clause Snuck In Your House, Stole All Your Cookies and Set Your House on Fire?](#what-if-santa-burnt-your-house-down)

Why call them the Anti-Santa? You start off believing they're not
real, but once you become about 30 years old, it's impossible to not
believe in them if you're not clueless. When you believe in them, if
you're good, they being you lots of coal. If you're real bad, they'll
bring you presents and then use your sins to destroy you later. They
don't come down your chimney, they sneak in your house and close the
flue, but only if you're worth the effort to cover their tracks. The
Illuminati almost never directly does *anything* because invisibility
is paramount: you can fight what you believe exists.

#### Cookies? So You Can Gaslight Me? Do I Look Like Hansel?

![Ain't Nobody Got Time For That]()

> Not gonna lie, I will eat your cookies though.

There is no one group though, why is partially why it's so easy to
forget they couldn't possibly not exist. The Illuminati is more of a
manifestation of evil that projects itself into the world through the
collective unconscious exigencies of the nature of power combined with
certain aspects of the human condition.

<a name="what-does-metaphysics-have-to-do-with-the-illuminati" />

# [What Does Metaphysics Have To Do With The Illuminati, Anyways?](#what-does-metaphysics-have-to-do-with-the-illuminati)

Furthermore, if you're trapped with the false paradigm of metaphysics
that ascends primarily from the material, you can never actually
believe they exist, rationally, which is why that false paradigm is
soo convenient to the Illuminati. This is partially why western
cultures will often present the opposite paradigm as heresy: because
if you believe in idealistic metaphysics, you actually can see what is
happening around you. If you don't, you're simply a powerless consumer
feeding the rich. This is yet another reason why Marxism is precisely
its own antithesis.  Marxism is not liberating, it is enslaving.

Idealistic metaphysics has its own problems, but new age voodoo is
easy enough to dismiss with a healthy dose of rationalism. Another
serious problem is that, once you sociologically extrapolate it, the
after the order du jour is established, your place in society is
almost entirely determined by your place at birth and the
sociophysical circumstances that surround you. If that such world
order or state order serves the people well, this is a very good
thing. If it does not, it can end up being horrible. As long as the
social contract must be upheld, the people are likely being served
well by their state. However, a well established order extrapolated
from idealistic metaphysics is difficult to disrupt.

What is an example of such an order? Japan. It is an incredibly strong
society with a rich culture and an incredibly strong sense of shared
identity, where even the language reflects this understanding of
metaphysics. It was only possible for Japan to develop all of this
because it was geographically isolated from the mainland, but China
shares many of these same qualities. Taoism and Shinto provide
interesting reflection on these ideas.

Therefore, there's not much chance for revolution and progress in the
class struggle without sociometaphysical churn: you need both. You
must *use* both the idealistically and materially derived
conceptualizations of metaphysics. Yet, the stability of a society is
incredibly important, so if the philosophical underpinnings of your
language, culture and state are not acceptably stable and strong, you
will not have a stable society.

### [You Only Get One Dialectical Method](#you-only-get-one-dialectical-method)

#### You're An Undergrad Philosphy Major In A Liberal Academic Safe Space.

#### You Must Choose Between Material Or Idealistic: Go!

They are basically the same process starting from opposite ends, in a
way. If I had to choose, what would I prefer? Idealistic metaphysics
because it is the truth and the truth sets you free. But some truths
are created and in themselves only are derived from happenings in the
material world: history. Of course history is truth that you must deal
with, but it is not THE Truth. The Truth is everywhere: it is timeless
and spaceless. The Truth echoes from beyond the material world and it
determines the course of all phenomena through fate.

So ... No, the Illuminati is not one group and that's worse! because
you can't so easily destroy them without either becoming them or
having another group swoop in to fill in the power vacuum. if you
don't accept this, you have no business trying to fight them because
you'll probably just make things worse.

![Magus Summoning Lavos](/img/posts)

The Illuminati, in is various incarnations, has been destroyed time
and time again, only to be reborn. They view themselves as necessary
evil *and they hate themselves for it*. That's important to rememeber,
since these psychotic assholes view love and hate to be identical
phenomena, essentially. They don't play fair and they push against
themselves to make themselves stronger, viewing the strongest, most
pure, most cunning as being the rightful de facto leaders in their own
invisible, decentralized power structures.

<a name="how-can-pindar-lead-an-anonymous-decentralized-group-of-cigar-smoking-men" />

### [How Can Pindar Lead an Anonymous, Decentralized Group Of
Cigar-Smoking Men?](#how-can-pindar-lead-an-anonymous-decentralized-group-of-cigar-smoking-men)

Why is "Pindar" their leader? Because Pindar's vision and authenticity
is unparalleled. They are constantly looking for the person that has
what they do not. Pindar is not a single person, per se. Pindar only
derives his authority from his resistance to their flame, but they do
not know who Pindar is because they are looking for the person who can
see what they do not. And the Illuminati have meticulously crafted
mechanisms for ensuring the properly networked architecture of
society, all decentralized and autonomous. It is outlined similarly to
the sheaf and the reaper, the merchant of souls.

So, they cannot recognize him, but because they seek to so tightly
control the prevalence narratives, myths and especially history, they
hate this person. He is the blinding one who tells stories they cannot
understand or writes truths which cannot so easily be perceived. They
hate him, but they need him because he can see what they cannot -- yet
a person like this can never be given power in their understanding of
the world.

# [What Was The Sword in the Stone?](#the-sword-in-the-stone)

The illuminati have crafted myth and legend, narratives of heroes
which are meant to play out generation after generation, that function
to establish filters that cause the virtuous, righteous and
intelligent to sift higher into society, so that their society is as
strong as possible. The sword in the stone is such a myth, probably
crafted by Merlin -- or the unknown historical Merlin.



- how does the Sword in the Stone sow the seeds of leadership across
  the british isles?
  - describe the potential sociological response to this myth.
  - if Merlin created the challenge, why could he not solve the Sword
    in the Stone himself and become king? Who would follow him if he
    had?
  - why could the myth not begin and end with Merlin: someone had to
    spead the myth. Behind the scenes, people had to acknowledge this
    leader as King of Britain. In this way, the myth of the Sword in
    the Stone was like a protocol for selecting King's Candidates.
    - so, on one end of this myth and protocol, you have all the
      common people and their children struggling to elect themselves
      king by sheer feat of strength. But no such brute force could
      unsheeve this sword. it didn't matter how physically strong you
      were: that was not the king that Britain needed. However, this
      challenge brought many to test their strength against the stone.
    - on the other side of the protocol, you had Merlin getting people
      to agree to follow the person who pulled the Sword in the
      Stone. They may have agreed and swore to follow a king they
      assumed would never exist: they believed that no man could ever
      exist that would accomplish such impossible feat of strength.
      - without people's tacit or explicit agreement to follow the
        future King Arthur, anyone could pull the sword from the stone
        and simply be a looney leader with no followers.
    - to getting this leadership-selection protocol to work, there
      were two main sociophysical mechanisms at play. The first is
      obvious: the magnetic allure to draw men to a central point of
      Britain to attempt to draw the sword. The more impossible the
      challenge seemed, the more magnetic it became. The second
      sociophysical mechanism was much harder to see: Merlin had to
      convince or swindle the informal, de facto leaders to agree to
      follow the champion who solved this riddle.
- Merlin was the classic wizard.


- who was the ideal king that merlin was looking for?
  - someone who was young and innocent, but heroic and incredibly
    intelligent.
    - someone who was young and innocent: not burdened by the karmic
      weight of information attributed to their actions.
      - because they would be so young, others could not use
        information about their mistakes to tear them down.
      - because they were so intelligent and understood how to solve
        the sword in the stone, they could be molded into the perfect
        leader for the early british isles.
        

- sociophysical paradox of karma and power: once you have power, you
  use it. even if you use power justly, you will create enemies:
  the petty who seek to pull you down, the
  - if the tribal leaders that Merlin convinced understood
    specifically why Merlin's king's candidate was ideal, then some of
    them capable of solving the sword in the stone may have avoided
    claiming kingship. This is the key to why the Sword in the Stone
    was so genius: Britain didn't need another king to rule by brute
    force, but instead needed the ideal king. So, it encouraged people
    to search for the ideal king, instead of fighting themselves to
    claim that right by brute force. In this way, one preemptively
    quashes the systemic sociological carnage associated with eternal
    conflict, where one brute topples another who topples another,
    each of whom merely sow the seeds for the next conflict. Instead,
    the ideal king is chosen behind whom all tribal leaders can invest
    their best energies and posture themselves outwards, not inwards.

- How do you solve the Sword in the Stone? It's a puzzle about
  thermodynamics that involves the Roman secrets of concrete. To make
  this sword, you must know the secrets of concrete. To solve the
  puzzle, one must know that iron is far more thermally conductive
  than concrete. Critically, one must know that the sword's volume
  deforms as a result of heat and, that if heat and cold are
  repetively applied, the structure of the surrounding concrete cannot
  tolerate this and cracks, requiring no strength at all. Therefore,
  the historical Arthur was most likely a blacksmith's apprentice, if
  such an Arthur ever existed. I believe he did. The ideal time to
  apply this process is well after everyone across the land has given
  up on solving it, otherwise people will steal the idea you are using
  to break the sword free, defeating the entire purpose of the King's
  selection game. If Romans ever used rebar in their concrete, this
  only strengthes my hypothesis that the game involved knowledge of
  Roman concrete.

What else is incredibly similar to thermodynamics? Social
physics. People behave as particles, heat can be channeled and entropy
matters. This is much easier to observe in the macroscopic behavior of
people than it is in the phenomena of matter. If you believe, as I do,
that people who intuitively understand some phenomena must have
neurological circuits which correspond to analytic approximations of
those phenomenon, then the person who understands intuitively
understands thermodynamics can develop a powerful understanding of
social physics. 

- If you believe, as I do, that people intuitively understood many of
the secrets of math behind science far earlier than relevated by the
prophets of rationalism, ...

- There is far too much baseless conjecture in the explanations above
  for any of it to be taken as fact. Still, if you avoid thinking
  about any of this on the basis that it's not factual, you're missing
  the point.

  - It would seem that all of the factors above imply the existence of
    a real historical Merlin. This historical Merlin may have
    factually been a Shakespearean
    [Junto](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Junto_(club)) of highly
    intelligent people, probably mixing druidic ideas with those left
    over from the Roman occupation of Caesar's geopolitical crowning
    jewel: Britain. Why were the Britain isles so important? Like
    Japan in the East, there was no way to conquer them without
    maritime invasion.

limbs are tightly controlled and restrained in isolation. These are

sadomasochistic. In fact, I'm pretty sure the Rothschilds would be on
my side -- they hate communism because it means they lose control over

Illuminati.

Sound like a leap to conclusions that your traditional schizophrenic
makes by inferrring the presence of arbitrary semio-linguistic
connections *that don't exist*? Ok, that's fair because it does sound
crazy. However you can, forget that linguistic connection because it's
stupid, arbitrary and trivial. Instead, read this excerpt from an
abstract on the subject.[^matroid-algorithm-computational-oracles]

#### From: [Complexity of Matroid Property Algorithms](https://doi.org/10.1137/0211014)

It means that algorithms requiring matroids are NOT computationally
friendly. Matroids eat all your energy. Algorithmic oracles, like
[padding
oracles](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Padding_oracle_attack), exist
as helpful shortcuts that can be leveraged to assert whether your
computations are proceeding in the correct direction or your algorithm
needs to take an entirely different direction.

If you don't understand, what that means is that America has gangraped
an Einstein on the floor of a train to Dashau. I should have a job. I
should be very, very successful. Instead, I'm expected to fucking work
at a McDonald's. Not only do I understand the 1,000 ft view of the
above, I can extrapolate the consequences phenomenologically and
sociologically. Someone else already did.



### Computational Hardness And (Inherent Leveraging) of Linguisitc Duplicity Means The Illuminati's Codes are Algorithmically Identifiable


- this was always going to happen
  - regardless of which secret society you consider, they all leverage
    morphemic duplicity to hide codes
  - there are many means of encoding information into text, speech,
    literature and language
    - almost none of these are sufficiently hard to be algorithmically
      secure.
    - one of the things i mentioned to Tatiana was the potential to
      algorithmically resolve ALL of the codes leveraged in

- almost all these codes are mostly insecure, which is why these
  groups intentionally spread them around so the multiplicity obscures
  their origin, enabling plausible deniability
- almost all the methods behind these codes are rankable in hardness.
  - it is preordained by the existance of the Singularity and the
    nature of unrestrained computation that these codes can and will
    be resolved in every sufficiently advanced society
    - around ... welll right the fuck now.

- connect these to (?)

- another reason why the argument over material origination of ideas
  and ideal origination of ideas is so important.
  - if ideas originate materially, this means that if the originator
    discloses them to someone, they can force that person to adhere to
    specific obligations, formally or even contractually. this is like
    what you sign your soul over for.
  - however, if ideas originate or congeal to the immaterial, it means
    that anyone can be the originator of either some or all ideas on
    their own by the force of sheer thought.
    - that is, your mind can find reach any idea if it is simply
      intelligent enough, which is a fantastic reason for these
      "illuminated ones" to identify intelligence early, so they can
      spoonfeed you simple information you would otherwise identify
      yourself, but bind your soul contractually for the rest of your
      life.
  - the truth is that all ideas at least cohere to or map to ideas
    that first originate from the ideal. otherwise, if this were not
    so, one could not reasonably make assumptions about other
    sufficiently advanced civilizations because every civilization
    would have its own specific divergent development. this is simply
    not true.
    - enthalpy is what causes the physical instantiations of
      materially metaphysical information to bind to and cohere to
      information which is purely immaterial -- it is timeless and
      spaceless.
      - in spite of the random, chaotic diffusion of high entropy,
        enthalpy encourages information to cohere to the immaterial,
        against all apparent odds.
      - if this were not the case, one could not expect the folding
        funnel hypothesis to hold up.

Apparently überpowerful people -- -- have an unnatural phobia of
illicit philosophy. More than anything else, they are scared of people
who think in new and different ways because peoples who are different
can't be predicted. Thus, sociologically constrain the typology &
metatypological aspects of psychology -- perhaps by introducing
artificial belief systems, however contemptuously you may hold them --
and people become like special dolls with meta/types imbued onto them
via Alchemy, like Manakin Skywalker right here.

#### Manakin Skywalker Does Airflares

![Manakin Skywalker Does Airflares]()

What does this imply for the computability of
past, current and future past social physics, in a future with
unrestrained quantum computing? If the myriad psychosocial
meta/typology of sociophysical entities is profoundly more expansive,
doesn't that make it harder to predict and control people? What does
that mean in the future? Considered from this basis alone -- *future
sociophysical computation* -- it is fascinating to think about the
phenomenological consequences: is it good or bad for people to be
unique?

### Dark Ruler

![Just Dark Ruler]()


There's hardly anything unique about this process of the evokation of
the combination of meta/typological psychosocial fragments within a
person. This process has been reinstantiated & reiterated & combinated
through the ages. Information warfare is competitive symbology where
the victors understand the evolutionary dynamics & actually had the
social/financial resources to play.

Überpowerful people generally cannot stand someone who encourages
people to think in unpredictable ways. This vastly expands the
sociophysical gamespace. They already have control. Why do they need
you? They rather wait it out and play it safe. You cannot be permitted
to enjoy success, fame or even a modicum of attention why you're
working with such magickal witchcraft as *novel ideas*. Those are
dangerous. Instead these elite would much rather watch as you quietly
flail in agony, so they can completely control the destiny of your
image after you die, sucking you dry while you live with no one around
to help you. This allows them to maintain control of your ideas,
preventing them from spreading,giving the überelite the time and space
they desparately need to react strategically to unprecented GENIUS.
This is why every living successful artist is probably a fraud and
every wildly successful artist has been dead for a generation before
anyone ever "discovered" him.

#### The Ironically Void Imagery of Communism In An Era of Automation

![Hammer and Sickle]()

These same people are relieved that humanity is becoming weak and more
predictable, even though to society at large, technology appears to be
doing the opposite. That is false: humanity is becoming weaker than
ever before because we are losing the ability to semeoteleologically
reproduce.

"Semioteleological" -- what does that word even mean? I invented it. I
checked. I have screenshots from google proving that no other person
EVER thought to use that word because no one has thought of
metatypological aspects of sociology so methodologically.

It perfectly describes why symbols whose meaning was so obvious for so
long have suddenly and nearly completely lost all their relevance to
humanity. thus, we are becoming completely disconnected from the myths
which helped inculcate the values systems via teleology. This will be
disastrous because we understand the world through symbology encoded
into language and myth. When that semioteleology is sufficiently
disrupted without anything to replace it, people don't relate to the
world, nor can they relate to each other.

We *think* that technology and science are all we need, but we are
wrong. We think that we no longer need religion or myth, but we are
sooo wrong. We have never needed it more.

The problem here is that every group who promises revolution ends up
being the same as those they quelled. Usually, at best, it's par for
the course. After considering the social carnage accompanying
revolution, it just doesn't leave the leaders of revolution with much
ground to stand on, morally. This is not always true, but it is very
difficult to justify a disruption in the (leadership/authority in a
society).

- three families close to the japanese emperor for hundreds of years
  - how this served the best interests of the japanese culture
    - before, during and after the time of Nobunaga
  - the emporer had the best interests of the state and the people in
    mind. to serve him was to serve the best interests of everyone.
    - but in order for the emperor and the state to serve the people,
      they had to be connected to the people.
    - over the course of generations, those close to the emperor, the
      families closest to his estate and to the government could
      "move" closer to the emperor by proving themselves
      - this is how it worked with most if not all monarchies, but
        it's interesting how well it worked in Japan, since that
        monarchy has lasted so long. It also lasted a very long time
        in Iran, so it'd be equally interesting to explore there.
      - this dynamic of moving closer and further from the monarch by
        having one's service/character assessed seems to have resulted
        in the system being architected around this.
        - japan also had very tight control of their culture. being
          east-most and geographically separate, they had less inward
          informational sociophysical flux than most, so this made it
          slightly easier to do so.
        - (it seems that this tight control of culture can be seen in
          Shinto, which is a religion that's not meant for people
          outside of japan AFAIK)
      - further, idealistic metaphysics is encoded into their
        language, grammar and thus culture. (see the particle "no")
        - this may cause the Japanese people to think about things
          differently, especially when compared to cultures speaking
          western languages, where there is so much emphasis on
          quantity, possession and the material.
          - i'm not saying one is better than the other...

#### The Dalai Lama As A Metaphysical Dynasty

- The mantle of the Dalai Lama is passed from one generation to
  another. The child to become the Dalai Lama must be identified by
  the Panchan Lama and initiated properly, otherwise he is *not* the
  Dalai Lama. China kidnapped the child identified to become the
  Panchan Lama. This means that this could not have been properly
  initated himself by the current Dalai Lama. If you believe this
  child is capable of identifying a true Dalai Lama in the next
  generation, you are a fool and know nothing of Tibetan traditions.

- How is this a unique dynasty? How is it a good selection of
  leadership for Tibet? To me, this is what is most intriguing about
  the position of Dalai Lama as the highest role of authority in
  Tibet.
  - I am speaking without knowing, but from what I perceive...
  - The Tibetan dynasty offers continual renewal without the conflict
    of revolution. It is presumed that the leader will not be
    concerned with any succession except a succession of the
    reincarnation of ideas. The meticulous reincarnation of the ideal
    values system for their leader.

- If the Panchan Lama is not initiated properly, the Lama lineage
  itself is threatened, but perhaps all is not lost. I don't want to
  explain precisely why.
  - this search for the next leader is not the work of one person or
    simply the people who surround him.

# Fighting with shadows

#### your enemy will be ruthless & destroy you immediately

#### learn to dance with them, you're going to need it.

#### wear your scars proudly. Commit yourself to no actions for which
the consequences you cannot wear proudly.

- they will try to shame you with both their values systems, your own
  and all the miscontortions of both.

- they will have a weapon that they will never let go of. it's not a
  fair fight. it never was. do not allow your space to become choked
  out: you need air, water, fire. you need people. you need food.

- when that one doesn't work, they have plenty more you've never
  seen. enjoy each and every one you get the chance to see because
  each one is special. some are never meant to be seen ... for long.

  - story of the house from "The Ancient Magus Bride"
  - some people never leave. you get to take one thing home with you.
    i took them all and made new ones.
  - the longer that you withstand baptism by fire without dying, the
    more of these you bring home with you.

#### make them grab the weapon they didn't intend to use. your weapon is
  the way itself.

#### bait them into breaking their precious things

#### grab their eyes with your fearless gaze & never let go


#### when they are certain you'll strike, feint instead



#### be ready to fight with shadows

- these are all the neutral people who have been poisoned against
  you. it is critical to remember that *they are not your enemy*.
  - you must become formless when you fight your true enemy.
- if you do not or cannot develop a "sixth sense" at this point, you
  should just give up.

#### once you will start fighting with shadows you will become weary fast

- you maintain this burn rate for sociophysical energy. every
  interaction you encounter will be seen as neutral by the other
  people, while they have heard much about you. be wary, you're under
  a microscope and anything you do will be used against you.
  - instead, display such radiant truth that those who are set against
    you cannot possibly continue to assail you.
  - in this way, they will become demoralized first, then will begin
    to question those who set them upon you. finally, they will
    realize the truth all along.
- however, if you are sociophysically isolated before this happens,
  you may wake up to realize you have nothing. there are several
  dangers here, but the truth is that nothing may become the greatest
  asset you have for carrying forward on the path you that should
  truly be on, which is your own path and the path of truth. both must
  be one and the same if you are to hope for success.
  - if you can resist falling for the first things your enemy offers
    you as appeasement, then you will find that having nothing offers
    your enemy nothing to take away. they have nothing to threaten and
    nothing to harm. you have nothing to lose. no one can claim you
    are predicating your decisions on what you have because you have
    nothing -- except the truth and what you stand for.
    - do not accept gifts from the source of your problems, if you do
      not validate them first. they may simply be trojan horses, at
      best.

- reference Mordecai protesting by wearing a potato sack

#### when they pull you into the hall of mirrors, you're fighting shadows
  of yourself that do not exist

- if they invite you to battle in the hall of mirrors, it is for
  show. they seek to desecrate your image and your story, using you as
  the moral to their story.
  - instead, you must destroy their images and your reflections
    too. destroy all of the image that cannot be used to serve your
    interests or feed your energy. it is the only way to win
  - let the only thing to remain be your own authenticity.

- when you cannot lose, slay them by pushing them into their own
  weapon: *THE ONE THEY NEVER INTENDED TO EXIST*

- know your enemy. know yourself
  - your enemy will see to throw you off guard by (pushing your
    buttons)

- in your victory, do not become your enemy, in who they were or are
  or in who you were or have become

- path of least resistance?
