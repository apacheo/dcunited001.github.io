# Fighting with shadows

#### your enemy will be ruthless & destroy you immediately

#### learn to dance with them, you're going to need it.

#### wear your scars proudly.

- Commit yourself to no actions for which the consequences cannot be
  proudly worn.

- they will try to shame you with both their values systems, your own
  and all the miscontortions of both.

- they will have a weapon that they will never let go of. it's not a
  fair fight. it never was. do not allow your space to become choked
  out: you need air, water, fire. you need people. you need food.

- when that one doesn't work, they have plenty more you've never
  seen. enjoy each and every one you get the chance to see because
  each one is special. some are never meant to be seen ... for long.

  - story of the house from "The Ancient Magus Bride"
  - some people never leave. you get to take one thing home with you.
    i took them all and made new ones.
  - the longer that you withstand baptism by fire without dying, the
    more of these you bring home with you.

#### make them grab the weapon they didn't intend to use. your weapon is
  the way itself.

#### bait them into breaking their precious things

#### grab their eyes with your fearless gaze & never let go


#### when they are certain you'll strike, feint instead



#### be ready to fight with shadows

- these are all the neutral people who have been poisoned against
  you. it is critical to remember that *they are not your enemy*.
  - you must become formless when you fight your true enemy.
- if you do not or cannot develop a "sixth sense" at this point, you
  should just give up.

#### once you will start fighting with shadows you will become weary fast

- you maintain this burn rate for sociophysical energy. every
  interaction you encounter will be seen as neutral by the other
  people, while they have heard much about you. be wary, you're under
  a microscope and anything you do will be used against you.
  - instead, display such radiant truth that those who are set against
    you cannot possibly continue to assail you.
  - in this way, they will become demoralized first, then will begin
    to question those who set them upon you. finally, they will
    realize the truth all along.
- however, if you are sociophysically isolated before this happens,
  you may wake up to realize you have nothing. there are several
  dangers here, but the truth is that nothing may become the greatest
  asset you have for carrying forward on the path you that should
  truly be on, which is your own path and the path of truth. both must
  be one and the same if you are to hope for success.
  - if you can resist falling for the first things your enemy offers
    you as appeasement, then you will find that having nothing offers
    your enemy nothing to take away. they have nothing to threaten and
    nothing to harm. you have nothing to lose. no one can claim you
    are predicating your decisions on what you have because you have
    nothing -- except the truth and what you stand for.
    - do not accept gifts from the source of your problems, if you do
      not validate them first. they may simply be trojan horses, at
      best.

- reference Mordecai protesting by wearing a potato sack

#### when they pull you into the hall of mirrors, you're fighting shadows
  of yourself that do not exist

- if they invite you to battle in the hall of mirrors, it is for
  show. they seek to desecrate your image and your story, using you as
  the moral to their story.
  - instead, you must destroy their images and your reflections
    too. destroy all of the image that cannot be used to serve your
    interests or feed your energy. it is the only way to win
  - let the only thing to remain be your own authenticity.

- when you cannot lose, slay them by pushing them into their own
  weapon: *THE ONE THEY NEVER INTENDED TO EXIST*

- know your enemy. know yourself
  - your enemy will see to throw you off guard by (pushing your
    buttons)

- in your victory, do not become your enemy, in who they were or are
  or in who you were or have become

- path of least resistance?
