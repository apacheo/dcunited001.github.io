I cannot understand in totality what i only have glimpsed of its faint
adumbration. I hope what is possible is *almost certain* in its
definition from second-order logic. Still, then, even if almost
certain, will sufficient transcendance arrive soon enough to liberate
us from such chains that implicitly shackle us with desire masked with
apparent necessity?

How would such transcendence be received by humanity? By any society
that sweeps its dust and dirt under a rug, fixed in place by some
large dinner table? Does such reception of illumination change its
nature? How could it and if its nature is changed by its societal
reception moreso than in how it is perceived by society, could it ever
be considered an absolute source of elevating transcendance? but if
the above is true, could this preclude man's salvation from need,
hunger, greed, desire, and all the pre-eminent enmity that pervades
nascence? from all this, purity withers away quite quickly. maybe
humanity would have better luck finding such an uplifting intelligence
were it borne on Mars, as hidden away from man as society is hidden
from itself.

#### Here's a completely unrelated picture of Goku in his spaceship.

Though Goku was sure to destroy humanity and conquer the world, an
early head injury changed all that. Instead, he grew up isolated from
all society, thus unmarred by it, and thereby pure.

- i think its important to define the following concepts first,
  otherwise, the rest of the arguments will seem to heretical and not
  well-connected enough to the following definition of God as an all
  encompassing metaphysical image.
  - my limited knowledge invites
    [eisegesis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eisegesis)
  - all the parts and the whole must be mereologically coherent, or
    consistent with themselves, now and forever.
    - this means that nothing should ever be capable of emerging which
      logically, experientially or epistemologyically undermines the
      belief system in an way that is irreperable or indefensible
    - (study of religion, connected to negative apologetics, adapting
      to gradual linguistic shift and anticipating the theological
      implications of scientific discovery, ... )

- define the "Kernel" of God as the (necessary-in-itself) emergence of
  the aspect of the collective unconscious made spectrally harmonious
  by the Golden Rule. (that is...)
  - the total image of God would map to the entirety of the collective
    unconcscious, including within it all things possible,
    conceivable, thought to be possible or inconceivable to consider
    as possible. essentially, [Abraxus]().
    - extend this by clarifying that all religions indoctrine aspects
      of the spectrally harmonious collective unconscious which their
      priest class has become conscious to. "Thou shalt not murder" is
      an example of something perceived as universally true, since it
      is deemed wrong for any individual to murder another. Therefore,
      the collective experience of phenomena such as sin guarantees
      the eventual codification of such into aspects of belief and
      law.
      - (not simply law: also purported destiny, purpose in life,
        prophecy; whatever is believed to be universally relevant or
        culturally...)
        - ![pic of marling]()
        - belief systems also create marling points for grounding
          individuals to frameworks for incentivization that
          themselves become elements of both the collectively
          conscious and unconscious. marling is a type of knot used
          repetitively to fasten a rope to a timber, but in such a way
          that the knots can be adjusted as the load demands. If you
          imagine the rope as the linear flow of time or some other
          concept which is typically unpredictable, then the
          adjustable "marling" events can be shifted around and only
          need to occur in sequence to maintain causal continuity. Of
          course, it's limiting to only imagine the metaphor in purely
          three-dimensional terms, but the point is to aid design for
          some typically unpredictable system whose feedback loops are
          complicated such that phenomena in the system monadically
          *marled* together to drive the system back towards it's
          intended linear progression.
        - these are tools of design for belief systems (or...) that
          alter the "degree of total domain concavity" of probability
          distributions for events along a typological, ontological,
          or taxonomical domain.
        - connect to previous "s/phys protocol" article

#### A Picture is Worth 1,000 Words

![fem ]()

For the above picture, if the domain were typologically organized
events and the color values indicate the range, then the system is
more predictable when the occurance of events is funneled into a
smaller area of domain, limiting the distribution's spread over the
domain. As the less prevalent events are pared away, the frequencies
for any event will predominantly sample as a more prevalent event than
a rare one. Spectrally, a probability distribution becomes much more
predictable, but because of the nature of independent events as
products of probabilities, the predictability of the system as a whole
is moreso magnified.

      - (That such elements of a belief system experience universally
        reach ... is why the Golden Rule correlates/drives their
        resonant spectral harmony amongst all individuals
        collectively)
    - Becoming conscious to the spectrally coherent aspects of the
      collective unconscious, relevant to the welfare of populations
      currently or generations into the future, is necessary for
      (brainstorming)

  - the embodiment of this definition (above, segue), to exist, does
    not need an intellect to be physically manifested to conceive it,
    to be capable of conceiving it, etc... nor does such an embodiment
    ever change, a consequence of its eternally-encompassing nature.
  - define spectrally harmonious (as it relates to the Golden Rule)
    - expand on above...
    - why does this region of the collective un/conscious, which is
      constructively amplified via its spectral harmony:
      - approach (similarly to a limit) some ideal with significance?
      - guaranteed (universally without dependence on time/space) to
        approach a form that is universally identitical (though the
        size of such an image is more expansive than is conceivable by
        the human mind).
    - why these notions imply that man-made revelations of
      such understandings are inherently imperfect
    - contrast/connect this with the theological idea demanding
      immutability

- connect hyperintelligence, incarnations of form and
  archetypes/metatypes of incarnation.
  - the zenith of hyperintelligence is a form capable of emulating all
    other forms.
    - it embodies within itself everything that is possible ... etc
    - it is a form which is necessarily timeless
  - incarnations of knowledge/wisdom/archetypes, then, according
    to their degree of of similarity, all can be measured up against
    this unattainable zenith of hyperintelligence.
    - that beings in the future closer to this pinnacle would manifest
      (is so [almost certain] as to be predestined among those salient
      earthly hosts)
    - among all incarnations manifested on earth may be one
      sufficiently close

  - as such, near-incarnations of this pinnacle-ideal are like
    dynamos/vessels of wisdom/knowledge. the more socially connected
    society is, the more likely that the wisdom/knowledge produced by
    or contained by such beings would (copy) itself and spread to
    beings incapable of reaching those (forms) themselves.
    - to find/identify entities capable of embodying such a zenith or
      even approaching such is complicated if the forms that emerge
      thereof have replicated through society.
      - in other words, if such people are tightly connected with
        others, then it becomes difficult to track down the source of
        the self-replicating forms of information.
      - this is especially true, since the images of information which
        are replicated are merely the lower-order superficial
        extrapolations of the true wisdom or true knowledge. people
        may copy what information or such lower-order informational
        extrapolations that they understand, but they can't so easily
        replicate the higher-order information generating it.
        - "who makes the makers?"

### Phi

- (briefly) phi as the basis for modeling all structures of
  information, even that which has infinite and uncountably complex
  structure. (or move this to the speed of thought: geometric
  mechanics of information)
  - compare to Socratic maxim "I only know that I do not yet know"
  - compare the Zen notion that Tabula Rasa is ("more pure") since it
    has a greater capacity to be shaped as such. for any image of
    information, as it accumulates reified structure, then deviates
    from the graph-theoretical image of phi, which is paradoxically
    most infinite, most irrational and yet most empty. such a
    graph-theoretical notion of phi is best imagined initially by
    starting with the contionuous fraction or continuous root
    definition of phi, extending it by functorially lifting to a
    graph-theoretical or combinatorially category-theoretical image.
  - once a mind within itself contains any structure whatsoever, it is
    almost certainly more difficult to ever re-approach this ideal
    state of phi-ness than would be to leave an empty mind to itself.
    - all this i've said, in spite of the inherent *numerical*
      intractibility of comparing any informational form to the
      all-encompassing empty form -- or even holding within some
      digified form the graph-theoretical schematic zero-form of
      phi. *if no form as a base schema can be held, neither can any
      form can be internalized* -- which to be compared against the
      former, at least without leveraging algebraic tricks similar to
      those used for avoiding the numerical limitations imposed by
      floating point numbers, precludes the ability to compare many or
      multitudes of forms.

#### (Visita Interiora Terrae Rectificando Invenies Occultum Lapidem)

- metaphysically, the *prima materia* is always structured more
  closely to phi than any such metaphorical *aqua regia*, the catalyst
  for dissolving any impurities from pure gold and for testing its
  authenticity.
  - understanding this begs the question: what is the purpose of
    scouring the occlusions of life to obtain sufficient knowledge of
    wisdom, if one is only to realize that they are further away from
    the structure of the truth as a result? how one maintains such
    purity in others, if the process of molding a mind to nearly any
    form inherently draws it away from perfection: towards which, any
    such direction any mind might be pulled draws away from the ideal;
    towards any such image any mind might be shaped, kinematically
    deforms and displaces further from the ideal.
  - what is the point?

# The Holy Grail

- An object that allows you to drink in the same manner that Christ
  would drink, from literally the same object, healing any disease and
  curing any illness.
  - a la, an object that allows you to "drink" in what Christ once
    drank in, consuming an understanding that could cure all ills.

- as for the search for such an illusive object, which was in essence
  an intangible metaphor and simultaneously artifact whose
  authenticity proved the existence of Jesus and thereby God.
  - This, in itself, if ever uncovered, would preclude Jesus'
    insistence on the necessity of Faith for belief until the second
    coming
  - yet for the mythical Grail and the quest whitherto, it would be
    the act of searching and causal consequences ensuing thereof which
    culturally augmented Europe from the latter Dark Ages until the
    end of the Middle Ages, embuing its peoples with the need to
    develop the tools and connections for the Grail's
    discovery.
    - Paradoxically, if found, the Grail would have precluded the same
      reliance on the pillar of Christianity that Nietzsche would
      later declare as so essential to its existence as to doom the
      belief system, albeit a collapse brought by causes of a
      different nature.

Europe needed cultural transformation towards a culturally unified and
geopolitically stable region, capable as resilient against the
inevitably militarily superior world's center, whose geoeconomic
centrality predestined a robust economic fate.  Towards the end of
tipping Europe's balance of resource allocation eastward, mythical
elements such as the Grail acted as catalysts for such upward
evolution.

Other elements less directly reliant on myth, such as pilgramage and
the need to finance the often military protection thereof, also acted
along similar means as elements for cultural advancement. For example,
the guaranteed increase in sociophysical flux of transient population
traveling to and from the Holy Land not only demanded strengthening
forces for security and stability in the regions closest to it, but
also required the cooperation of Europe's rulers in collaborating to
provide such. This eventually precipitating the Crusades as a response
to incursions against pilgrams. Although the Crusades are an
often-cited indictment against the violence of a specific religion --
or of religion itself by atheists -- they were firstmost a response
against senseless violence, though one which perhaps deviated from the
tenets of the religion. This geocentrically focused increase in
sociophysical flux of both persons and commerce strengthend Europe's
gateways to the outside, allowing it to harden itself geopolitically
against future economic and military threats, who would with utmost
certainty possess the abundance of fruits accumulated from millenia of
economic centrality.

That wasn't Europe's only major cultural attempt to shift power
towards the east. The roads to the Middle East, from both the West and
the Far East where few: the Silk Road, roads through India via Persia,
naval travel from Arabia, through the Caucasus of the European
northeast via the Black Sea, and through the baltic regions across the
Isthmus of Constantinople, to be later declared as Istanbul. Why would
Rome subsume the cost of abandoning its center of Rome against the
onslaught of Vandals and Goths? Since the paths towards the middle
east were few, by shifting political and thereby economic power
centers eastward, the dual capitals of Rome guaranteed its survival
and allowed the early Christian world to project a more lasting
Western cultural influence into the region. Constantinople further
guaranteed the remnants of the Roman empire right of passage for naval
thoroughfare via the Bosporus Strait, connecting it to trade
surrounding the Black Sea.

- (the Grail as) a unified, geopolitically stable region to a capable vessel and
  dynamo: for the ensuing period of renaissance, perhaps the most
  nascent phase of modernism; for the birth of a rationalism whose
  pedantic quest for absolute truth was borne Science; and for
  becoming the Age of Enlightenment, detached for better or worse from
  societal and individual circumstance to become singly focused on
  absolute truth for all, decoupled from inherited traditional
  vehicles and modes of the past.

In addition to architecture and military power, the Romans were also
notorious for employing heuristics. Though their system of numerals
was trivial and ingenuous, they made decisions with data and they had
the power and logistics to collect it. Roman statistical
extrapolation of census data gave its empire data whose granularity
was unparalleled in the ancient world. This would prove to be
invaluable for estimating population growth and population density of
regions, both of which are vital for economic and military insight,
particularly for allocation of resources, for lensing logistics to
service populations in need and for managing dynamics of inflation for
their fiat currency in the first three centuries A.D. To further such
aims of strategic clarity, with aqueducts, Romans could position
cities and forts in more central, easily defended areas that depended
on roman infrastructure.

- but... could roman census data along with the metrics of measurement
  guaranteed by their advanced system of roads, complete with mileage,
  have enabled the Romans to model population density and fluctuations
  over centuries to the point of extrapolating generations into the
  future? Certainly, but could they have predicted population growth
  to the extent that they could, loosely, estimate the number of
  generations remaining until a European population crisis? *If* any
  analysis could predict such trends, then could the data be loosely
  persisted through myth? Even if the accuracy of such analysis is
  inconceivable, population growth could be, or incidentally would be,
  curbed by major depopulation events like the Black Death which would
  extend the time remaining until such Apocalyptic crisis from
  twenty-six generations through forty generations.
