#### "Please, Sir, You Are Blocking The Light Of Mathematics"

![Death of Archimedes](/img/posts/2017-10-10-speed-of-thought-social-physics/death-of-archimedes.jpg)

There are countless aspects of life that ancient people understood
more clearly than we do today. In many, standing on the shoulders of
giants has yielded crippled versions of ourselves because we were
always molded and die-cast by a typology of life experience now
*decimated* by technology.

#### Into The Tragic Comedy of Fate, I Cast Myself

![Medea -- from Fate! Jesus Christ!](/img/posts/2017-10-10-speed-of-thought-social-physics/fate-caster-medea.jpg)

For the powerful, this is desirable. They can sell us technology to
solve our problems, while our growing dependencies on it
short-circuits the types of life experience that imbue our
worldview. In some ways, this makes us easier to control. We simply do
not have the same sheer drive that powers those of us who have learned
through pain and all the simple joys we'll never know. For all its
benefit, power and utility, Technology can never replace this value of
the struggle. The societies who artificially maintain these mechanisms
enjoy prosperity *and remain strong*.

# [A Marathon and Thermopylae for the Spartan](#a-marathon-and-thermopylae-for-the-spartan)

At the battle of Marathon, the Greeks defeated the Persians. News of
this victory was so critical that Pheidippides ran over twenty miles
to bear news of it's victory. Every marathon you run is part of a
millenia-old celebration of being the first to deliver a message.

What's the value of a message? How does cheap and free transmission
affect us? How does it lead to progress? The power of a simple message
unimpeded can change the course of civilizations. At Thermopylae, the
brave acts of hundreds of Spartans struck fear into the heart of
Persians and funneled vigor into the hearts of Greeks to rise up and
resist the oncoming hordes. Would this envigorating effect have been
possible if not for the story? *What if it couldn't be told?*

#### Thesus in America - Sails

Look at what disconnection has wrought. No one truly participated in
this willingly. I will wait until I am judged for what I have said and
done.

### [Novel Types of 21st Century Territory and Their Thermopylaean Chokepoints](#novel-types-of-21st-century-territory-and-their-thermopylaean-chokepoints)

The importance of Thermopylae to the Spartan victory was their
tactical utilization of the territory. It's the greatest story of
deception leading an army to a chokepoint. Today, with information
warfare, sociohierarchical conflict, economic warfare, there are many
novel kinds of territory. For each type and metatype of territory,
where are the imaginable chokepoints?

<a name="an-eden-of-sociocultural-experimentation-borne-from-the-idiosyncratic-geography-of-greece" />

### [An Eden Of Sociocultural Experimentation, Borne From The Idiosyncracic Geography of Greece](#an-eden-of-sociocultural-experimentation-borne-from-the-idiosyncratic-geography-of-greece)

During the first millinea B.C., a confluence of Greek
technology, culture and geography, encouraged a philosophic
exploration of human life. In particular, the Greek city-states
flourished at a time where reflection on the structure of society
itself was encouraged, where its evolution occured at a rapid pace and
operated long enough without being domineered by an external
force. This itself wasn't unique, but we managed to maintain their
literary tradition. In doing so, we preserved the best record this
phenomenon in Western history.

#### Socrates Engaging the Greek Agora In Philosophic Debate

![Schizophrenic Socrates' Added Nothing of Value To Society With His Constant Akathisia](/img/posts/2017-10-10-speed-of-thought-social-physics/socrates-agora.jpg)

<a name="social-and-informational-thermodynamics-and-convexity" />

# [Social and Informational Thermodynamics and Convexity](#social-and-informational-thermodynamics-and-convexity)

In the ancient world, population growth and movement was tightly
coupled to economic opportunity, constrained by resources, and bounded
by geography. Population quantity drives the total quantity of
information and increases rate at which innovations occur via the
network effect. Population density increases the rate at which
information moves in those sociophysical networks.

Imagine humans as particles with random motion whose individual speed
of vibration depends on available vehicles of transit, intended
destination, resource distribution and other factors. The particles
vibrate in patterns, almost certainly originating from some home point
and returning to it every day. When these particles hit the ocean at a
port, they accelerate like sound hitting a solid barrier, assuming
these people have ships and sails.

<a name="thermal-convection-of-information" />

### [Thermal Convection of Information](#thermal-convection-of-information)

Imagine the sun rising in the Far East. It heats up the air and water,
giving us wind and ocean currents, but doesn't its sociophysical
energy also reverberate through humanity? As the world turns each day,
there is random motion moving from the east to the west, driving
social interactions. Pushing through the noise are faint, low
frequency waves of cultural information rippling over and reflecting
between geographic features. Vacuums of low population density tapers
this resonance. Between the centers of civilization, the dispersion of
information is strained through translingual membrane, limiting the
number of social connections over which information can cross. These
metaphors are not perfect, as behavior was not coordinated and our
modes of transportation were limited throughout history.

#### Land of the Rising Sun: Low-Frequency Sociophysical Currents Emerge from the East

![Land of the Rising Sun Watercolor](/img/posts/2017-10-10-speed-of-thought-social-physics/jp-rising-sun-watercolor.jpg)

<a name="humanitys-measures-of-connectedness-vary-geographically" />

### [Humanity's Measures of Connectedness Vary Geographically](#humanitys-measures-of-connectedness-vary-geographically)

Consider the human population distribution of 5,000 BC. At this time,
we had dispersed from Africa through the Middle East and around the
Black Sea to India, Europe, China, Indonesia and the Americas. At that
time, was there a region more connected than others? The most
connected region was the Middle East. And people less connected?
Those in island nations or beyond the tropics of Cancer and Capricorn,
both of which would incidentally be more likely to understand the
spherical shape of the earth.

<a name="mesopotamia-and-mesoamerica-the-old-world-connectivity-maximums" />

### [Mesopotamia And Mesoamerica: The Old World Connectivity Maximums](#mesopotamia-and-mesoamerica-the-old-world-connectivity-maximums)

As for the Middle East, its high degree of connection, its proximity
to geographic chokepoints and its access to large swaths of ocean
surface area gave it an almost unparalleled economic advantage, which
only grew as time marched on. This region had the shortest actual
distance to the most number of people, and access to the largest
social graph neighborhoods, depending on how you measured it. When
people are more widely spread out, it is more rare to have large 2nd
and 3rd degree networks, which conferred major advantages. Those with
wealth could finance transport and delegate action, which further
helped expand those networks.

The shifting power centers of Olmec, Maya, Inca and Aztec repositioned
the Mesoamerican nexus of connectivity. Why? Strategic control over
the Panamanian isthmus conferred the same economic and sociophysical
benefits as control over the Mesopotamian region. The power centers
shifted in America, just as they did for the center of the Old World.

<a name="north-korea-as-a-global-minimum-of-connectivity" />

### [North Korea as a Global Minimum of Connectivity](#north-korea-as-a-global-minimum-of-connectivity)

North Korea is an example of a major concave depression in
sociophysical graphs. This leads to restricted economic growth and
almost total disconnection of the populace from the outside. Both of
those lead to poor decisions by the North Korean leadership. They are
so disconnected from the rest of the world, coupled with internal
policy to ruthlessly quash all information contradicting state policy,
that their upper leadership isn't allowed to question the highest
leadership.

If the range of 2&deg; neighborhoods of North Korean citizens is
compared against other nations, you'll find that it is incredibly
limited when compared to similarly sized populations. Proportional to
their population, they might be the *most socially-restricted nation
on earth*, which is unbelievably depressing. Pictured below is a graph
visualization of what North Korea's socioeconomic connections might
look like. Alternatively, you can relabel North Korea as "Me" and the
Int'l Economy as "American Society."

#### Graph Visualization of North Korea's Economic Connections

![Economic Disconnection](/img/posts/2017-10-10-speed-of-thought-social-physics/north-korea-disconnected-2.jpg)

How can you compete in the global economy if your regime prohibits
communication with the outside and punishes dissidents with three
generations of family persecution? How can you export products if your
citizens cannot freely establish relationships with people and
businesses in other countries? Some of the fault here lies with NK and
some of it lies with sanctions, but your nation is pursuing nuclear
weapon development and its belligerent PR stunts show no remorse for
this goal. In spite of UN sanctions, the regime undermines its own
potential development of exports and economic competitiveness. You are
missing out on the greatest period of human development because you're
stewing over something that happened four generations ago.

<a name="north-korean-paranoia-undermined-their-posture-for-economic-development" />

### [North Korean Paranoia Undermined Their Posture For Economic Development](#north-korean-paranoia-undermined-their-posture-for-economic-development)

The future of the world lies in the information economy and
information warfare. Today, what matters most is the sociohierarchical
territory and informational territory that sets you up to maintain
prosperity. How can you ever expect to compete in the information
economy with completely restricted access to the internet and
near-zero consumer adoption of internet-capable devices? You can't,
which begs the question: who is informing your leadership's long-term
strategies? In a digital economy, products are informational. NK
citizens simply can't be consumers or producers of content. AFAIK, NK
citizens aren't even allowed to have radios because NK paranoia is
stuck in the 1960's soviet mindset of information control.

<a name="all-significant-revolutions-expect-paranoia-for-their-violent-treacherous-transgressions" />

### [All Significant Revolutions Expect Paranoia For Their Violent, Treacherous Transgressions](#all-significant-revolutions-expect-paranoia-for-their-violent-treacherous-transgressions)

All communist revolutions expect such paranoia *and they use it!* Even
for those non-Marxist revolutions -- viz. all revolutions with
significant turnover of control -- the leadership expects that the
employment of pre-revolutionary subversion to gain sociohierarchical
territory involves dirty tricks with disgusting karma. So, they plan
on using it. But, in trying to undermine any possibility of dissent --
and by being disconnected from the world with poor strategy being
supplied from the largests connections outside -- North Korea has left
itself in a position, where there is zero consumer adoption for
hardware, which is necessary for economic expansion. It's total
paranoia of imperialism has left itself deprived of any economic
opportunity, even if it does pull off being a pawn for initiating
nuclear war. North Korea needs to come to the negotiation table and we
need to sort this out. The first thing that must happen is total
nuclear disarmament and the rest of the world is infuriated that NK
leadership expected to use nuclear weapons as bargaining chips.

<a name="north-koreas-strategy-never-had-an-endgame" />

### [North Korea's Strategy Never Had An Endgame](#north-koreas-strategy-never-had-an-endgame)

North Korea's strategy has no endgame, other than becoming an international
school shooter. Since the 1980's, this strategy has left No hardware
platform for internet, no participation in the information economy, no
media creation tools, no training or education on those tools, no
content production, no culture export, no connections developed and
interactions with the outside are discouraged. How did the North
Korean leadership miss this? Because they artificially dampen all
signal that could be perceived as dissent, wavering, or retreat. This
enables the prolonged development of silent risk and massive tail
risk, as Nassim Tebar would probably put it. NK is actually far-left
with components of far-right ideology.

<a name="america-and-europe-as-a-modern-sociophysical-connectivity-maximum" />

### [America and Europe as a Modern Sociophysical Connectivity Maximum](#america-and-europe-as-a-modern-sociophysical-connectivity-maximum)

America, Europe and the West form the connectivity maximum of the
world. This gives us diversity and some challenges related to
multiculturalism. However, those issues must be overcome eventually
and we did so early. Further, our populations are inundated in
collective understanding of even cultural minutia via the
encouragement of connection to peoples of all ethnicity and
culture. This starkly departs from the traditional wisdom in the Art
of War where you insulate your culture from any external influence,
yet in the modern world, it results in perhaps the greatest advantage
that we have. Why? The world is one and always has been one. We must
overcome these issues at some point and we have, which has also made
America and Europe and other highly connected non-Western regions
connectivity maximums. This fuels our platform for economic growth.

<a name="artificial-diminuation-and-amplification-of-information-yields-dangerous-self-delusion" />

### [Artificial Diminuation and Amplification of Information Yields Dangerous Self-Delusion](#artificial-diminuation-and-amplification-of-information-yields-dangerous-self-delusion)

Furthermore, we'll never find ourselves in an isolated fortress, which
is
[Law #18 of the 48 Laws of Power](https://48laws-of-power.blogspot.com/2011/05/law-18-do-not-build-fortresses-to.html). If
we do not artificially silence this diversity of signal, we can remain
apprised and aware of our nation and developments in the international
world. Instead, it seems we artificially mute signals on the basis
that they are different. Since people often become conditioned to fear
that which they don't understand, it shrinks the needles in the
haystack that are precious, distinct forms of information, which
should clue us into developments we must react to. In highly
permeable, tightly connected information environments, we are more
likely to receive those signals, unless we enact policy to stimulate
widespread fear over anything that might be different. There is some
information that is dangerous, but we are throwing the baby out with
the bathwater.

<a name="the-birds-eye-view-of-social-physics" />

# [The Bird's Eye View of Social Physics](#the-birds-eye-view-of-social-physics)

When an eagle looks down, using it's impressive eyesight to soak up
what it can, does the world appear as 3D or 2D? It's perspective from
that height provides a dimensional reduction and the details it
absorbs enables it to see shapes and patterns emerge in individual and
social behaviors, unaware to the animals engaging in those
behaviors. Humanity might think itself peaking the top of the food
chain, but birds of prey are also elevated among the rest of animals
in many ways. This status creates the imagery and fuels the strong
symbolism that motivates the depiction of birds of prey in national
flags, as well as their prominent place in myth and culture. By
observing birds of prey from a distance, if you're lucky enough to see
on, you can indirectly glean information about your surroundings, if
you're wise and foolish enough to make those inferences.

<a name="do-you-see-what-i-see" />

### [Do You See What I See?](#do-you-see-what-i-see)

Sociophysical systems are usually too complex to yield perfectly
scientific evidence, these metaphors and metrics are invaluable tools
yielding philosophic insights. They sharpen our inductive reasoning
for social behavior and history, giving us options that will yield
concrete scientific evidence. Most social systems modeled with
physical components are incomputable, but computational social science
is harnessing these ideas today.[^pos-sensitive-propagation]

<a name="an-infinite-dimensional-generalization-of-physics-and-molecular-dynamics" />

### [An Infinite-Dimensional Generalization of Physics and Molecular Dynamics](#an-infinite-dimensional-generalization-of-physics-and-molecular-dynamics)

Information has a life of its own. Nowhere does this become more clear
than in social physics, which is a mathematical framework for modeling
idealized social behavior with physical constraints. The initial
revelations of social physics yield mind-blowing epiphanies for
structuring, objectifying and quantifying social interactions. The bad
news: almost every problem is incomputable. Still, one can extrapolate
incredibly useful insights from the mere philosophic exploration of
social physics.

<a name="a-19th-century-attempt-to-quantify-sociological-phenomena" />

### [A 19th Century Attempt to Quantify Sociological Phenomena](#a-19th-century-attempt-to-quantify-sociological-phenomena)

#### This Ain't Nobody's First Rodeo

Social physics was originally developed in the 19th century to
quantify sociological situations and particularly how the behavior of
players in social games are affected by the imposition of physical
constraints. It originally borrowed heavily from classical mechanics
and now overlaps with quantum mechanics, since non-deterministic games
are loaded with probabilistic mechanics. Social physics can help us
understand team sports, advanced
[swarm behavior](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Swarm_behaviour), the
geometric mechanics of battle tactics, cocktail parties and the finer
mysteries of feng shui. Each of those activities (determined by the
physics of the space) space and players in a social game with rules,
though with feng shui, the game and players may be less clearly
defined.

#### Essais sur la Mechanique Social (Winiarski, 1898)

<a name="how-does-the-information-schema-affect-the-spatio-temporal-computability" />

### [How Does The Information Schema Affect The Spatiotemporal Computability?](#how-does-the-information-schema-affect-the-spatio-temporal-computability)

If you begin modeling games where players have their own sets of
information, social physics is rendered irrevocably and hopelessly
incomputable, almost immediately. Each additional layer presents its
own challenges of tractibility and data structure countability.
Simulations that can be parallelized with a GPU have tight information
schema requirements. Knowing this, how do you identify what can be
modeled and made known? How do you structure an organization's
logistics and data collection requirements to efficiently model social
phenomena and information dynamics? What's the difference between what
can be simulated and what can be inferred via data science?
Specifically, what schematic components and strucural patterns
increase the space and time required for computation?

#### &#x2605; Do the players contain their own copies of information or is it shared?

#### &#x2605; Do instances of information adhere to a defined schema shared among all players?

#### &#x2605; Can the information schema be modified?

#### &#x2605; Can the information be known in totality for the game?

#### &#x2605; Can a player access their own information in totality or reflect on its schematic structure?

#### &#x2605; Do players need to make inferences based on the information schemas of other players?

From the short list above, it isn't clear which adds the most
complexity or how, but players almost always operate with incomplete
understanding in social situations. They can do so effectively because
they've been conditioned to develop sets of proactive and reactive
behaviors sidestep the issues of scale and complexity. The particular
tactics to handling or circumvent complexity create their own dynamics
for information in sociophysical games. Information overload can
negatively affect players. The topics pertaining to information schema
and information reflection add an incomprehensibly infinite degree of
complexity. For the mathemtaticians, yes, modifiable schemas with or
without reflection are definitely uncountable.

<a name="sports-like-soccer-or-football-are-well-defined-sociophysical-games" />

### [Sports Like Soccer Or Football Are Well-Defined Sociophysical Games](#sports-like-soccer-or-football-are-well-defined-sociophysical-games)

All of this means that players have to be good at handling
information, but better at balancing uncertainy and risk with
goal-seeking behavior. If the game being modeled is soccer or some
other team sport, there are subtle sociophysical micro-tactics that
can vastly improve team performance, such as ensuring visibility and
other mechanics of assessment and communication. If the team works
together and can share its understanding of the state of the field,
this can help immensely with coordinating tactics.

There are other physical aspects of soccer which are also modeled by
social physics, such as the typical FIFA 2017 stats: speed, energy,
skill, etc. The best players in the world can play together, but
unless they can read each other and anticipate the coordination of
tactics with limited signaling, the games will be reduced to the more
physical stats and positioning.

Social physics is distinguished from physics and simple models of
swarm behavior by providing a framework where players react to
informational components and dynamics emerging from information. This
framework starkly contrasts simple probabilistic models for social
behavior with its focus on the spatial components and particle
interactions.

# [Postulates of Sociophysical Systems](#postulates-of-sociophysical-systems)

Extrapolating from a basic assessment of the math, there are
implications and ramifications that attain preponderance, standing
above everything else.  Stubbornly clinging to ideology constructed
around fast-fading pyschosocial paradigms, novel sociophysical
phenomena instead remain unseen shadows whose origins in ancient
social foundations elude us: not for some innate opaque ignorance, but
for the lust to control knowledge for power. History has blessed
humanity with incidental inculcation of wisdom, channeled through
obvoluted teleology -- now rendered preterite by foredominant
postponderence. Tapped into leylines carved from bedrock, as these
[qanat](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Qanat) rapidly sublimate from
[Anamnesis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anamnesis_(philosophy)), our
utopic oasis will invisibly fade as a mirage.

By failing to fully understand sociophysical phenomena, by stubbornly
clinging to ideology constructed around fast-fading psychosocial
paradigms.  By refusing to allow adaptation, we fall victim to
Nietzche's danger of dangers. This is not to say that morality and
well-defined, top-down values systems will themselves be antiquated.
Quite the opposite: we need to reinforce those systems that already
exist, but augment them with agile, flexible and antifragile values
systems that can fill in the gaps. For their followers, any such
belief systems must unfold into values systems with strong unifying
force, arising from a basis for values sharing a common root of truth.

#### Magnetic Field Lines From Two Adjacent Electromagnets

![Magnetic Field Lines](/img/posts/2017-10-10-speed-of-thought-social-physics/magnetic-field-lines.jpg)

Today, the world needs everyone on the same page. In order to operate
cooperatively in more virtualized sociophysical systems, we must first
develop a clear understanding of their purely physical counterparts.
Psychological and sociological understanding has always been the
mostly useful knowledge, especially when there was little technology
and nothing to use for the construction of great works but the hands
of men.

Just as the laws of particle physics are modeled as objects
interacting energetically with shared fields, sociophysical phenomena
also operate with fields and energy. The difference is that social
physics is the ultimate abstracted generalization of physical laws and
thus, to say that it is infinitely more complex means you have a
limited conceptualization of infinities.

The most important shared field is the field of attention. In all
physical and virtual social interations, people want to know what
other people are interested in: they are asserting and measuring
perceived beliefs to mitigate the system's complexity. Imagine this
field in a physical example to entertain an idea of the maximal and
minimal strength of force on this field. You're at home, alone. Does
anyone know where you are? Is your behavior going to influence someone
else's behavior? No. Without internet, your impact on the shared field
of attention is nearly zero.

#### Semblable Magnetism Aligns The Orientation Nearly Every Fan's Field of Vision To The Center of Action

![Hockey Stadium](/img/posts/2017-10-10-speed-of-thought-social-physics/hockey-stadium.jpg)

Now imagine yourself at a concert or a football game. People exert
influence on the shared field of attention with their focus. Their
field of view, as it is perceived by other people, exhibits an effect
on the field of attention. People are always looking to see where
other people are looking. The laplacian of a field tells us how this
changes, when and where. So, at a concert or football game, if all the
people were particles, they would be magnetically aligned to the field
lines. At a concert or football game, there would be a nearly maximal
value for the deformation in the field.

<a name="mechanics-of-social-interactions-and-connections-are-physical-and-logical-but-increasingly-virtualized" />

### &#8855; &#8710; &#8968;ii&#8969; [Mechanics of Social Interactions And Connections Are Physical and Logical, But Increasingly Virtualized](#mechanics-of-social-interactions-and-connections-are-physical-and-logical-but-increasingly-virtualized)

Via these shared fields, people influence each other via sociophysical
energy exchange. These fields are mapped ontop of physical and logical
spaces and we can intuitively measure the flow of energy across
them. Unlike the electromagnetic field, these fields are individually
conceptualized, so there are infintely many of them and infinitely
many energy types. Moreover, equivalent exchange of energy is almost
never preserved. While there are mechanics of energy exchange and
transduction, the nonlinearity makes the conversion of energy types
difficult to anticipate.

These fields can be imagined as spaces with the potential to
facilitate sociophysical energy exchange -- with a strong departure
from physics: there is pronounced variation in the topology of the
spaces. There are field with physically derived topology, graph
topology and any kind of conceivable topology. These are simply tools
for attempting to model what is far more complex than can ever be
known.

The importance of sociohierarchical structures has always entailed the
use of logical, non-physical components to strategize or anticipate
sociophysical phenomena. These topologies, either fully or partially
derived from logical relationships between people, groups, or other
nodes, form fields where the energy mechnics operate like electrical
circuits. These are emergent logical topologies, overlayed onto
physically interacting particles via the social graph funct.

Electrical networks are an example of physical phenomena with a
logical graph-based structure overlayed on top. When determining the
structure and components of circuits, would you first consider the
physical proportions of the components or the types and structures of
components? What happens when you remove components like resistors or
capacitors from series or parallel circuits? Does it help much to
first think about physically derived microphenomena of the system,
like the [Skin Effect](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Skin_effect)? Or
would you start with top-down methods to examine the phenomenological
end-goals of circuit structure: whether it a logical network of
components forms an amplifier or a transformer?

In reasoning about these systems and the range of possibilities, the
resulting dynamics and mechanics are neither purely physical or purely
logical. By logically reasoning about the systems and gradually
accreting structure, we attain flexible, efficient skill to
combinatorially evaluate circuit structures to achieve a maximum of
phenomenological agility.

On top of the physical world, we have constructed technology that
facilitates instantaneous communication, starting with the telegraph.
This has rapidly progressed, giving us the phone system, the early
internet and culminates in nearly superconnected networks of optical
cable. The world is well aware this means the digital world is more
relevant than the physical. What we're not ready for is the pure
manisfestation of the metaphysical into the physical realm.

Today, almost all human communication is, in full or in part, being
conducted across this logical communication infrastructure. The
majority of artifacts of human interaction and human activity are now
purely or mostly digital. Most critically, the physical aspects of
sociophysical conceptualization, strategy and tactics are less
dominant. The virtual and logical aspects are instead being amplified
to such a degree whereby the physical is almost secondary. The
logically derived topologies, such as sociohierarchical structures and
relationships, now matter more than ever.

Superconnected communication infrastructure evinces novel conditions
of possibility for sociophysical phenomena humanity has never
encountered. Other phenomena will seem to be radical departures from
dynamics and mechanics we know and love in modernity. Therefore, our
generations should begin conceptualizing their world primarily in
terms of these logically and informationally derived spaces. Again,
these tools for strategizing and managing human interactions have
always existed in one form or another, but hidden from most. However,
this purely physical world is no longer the one we live in, but if we
do not retain our individuality, our humanity and our sense of
purpose, nihilism will rapidly corrode through any system structure,
no matter how antifragile.

#### CPU's Are like Metaphysical Copy and Paste

![CPU Chip Fabrication](/img/posts/2017-10-10-speed-of-thought-social-physics/intel-cpu-wafer.jpg)

What is the CPU? What does it represent? Mastery over physics and
solid-state chemistry? Doesn't it also represent mastery over logic,
math, Gödel, Turing and especially [Von Neumann machines]()? Nevermind
that, it represents the manisfestation of all this knowledge into the
physical plane, whereby the metaphysical facsimilarly imbues itself
into the structure of matter. This is the physical reification of a
materialistic or idealistic conception of the metaphysical: a machine
capable of executing instruction sets, numbered according to

### &#8855; &#8710; &#8968;iii&#8969; [Power Describes The Rate of Energy Fluxing Through Sociophysical Networks](#power-describes-the-rate-of-energy-fluxing-through-sociophysical-networks)

When conceiving social circuitry, people, groups and roles all form
components in networks that conduct, magnify, time and regulate
sociophysical energy flows. Electrical components can be conceivably
form metaphors for a typology of social circuit network design.  In
such circuits, social energy flows through networks where all
components are connected. Disrupting any power flow and affects all
power flows. Changing, reversing, inserting, tuning the components
influences the flow of power and energy flux across the rest of the
systems.

Perhaps using different terms, Nietzsche was attempting to explain how
the opportunity costs of both sociophysical energy investment or
alterations of sociohierarchical components. When conceptualized with
the language of circuitry, this becomes more clear. Did Nietzsche
understand what one can attempt to quantify with non-linear energy
mechanics? In such non-linear systems, energy equivalence is almost
never preserved.

Similar to power in electrical networks, sociophysical measures of
power are defined as the potential to trigger flux through social
networks and the rate of that flux. In this way, other metaphors can
be applied to power and information flows; voltage, amperage, logic
gating, albeit these operate in an extremely-high dimensional
way. Further, there is no comparison between the near infinite and the
infinite: infinitely dimensional models are functionally divergent
from their dimensionally-bounded linear counterparts. There is the
curse of dimensionality, but then infinite dimensional math imposes
profanity-inducing limitations...

#### Many Consequences of Sociophysical Energy Flux Can Be Imagined:

#### &#x2605; Physical Change

#### &#x2605; Sociohierarchical Change

#### &#x2605; Belief Structure Change

#### &#x2605; Change or Stagnation in Conditioned Behaviors

#### &#x2605; Informational Change

#### &#x2605; Informational or Hierarchical Schematic Change

So, then *potential for power* is defined as the capacity to project
these changes into the world and *action of power* is defined as the
rate of these changes, however enigmatic power may be to quantify,
since the infinite variety of energy and transduction pathways render
all intractible. Perhaps our inability to understand ourselves is a
curse; perhaps it is a blessing.

The forms above are base types of changes to sociophysical
structures as a result of the exertion of power. What we see in life
are reconfigurations of the above. That is, we see the likes of:

#### &#x2605; Informational Change Yielding Physical Change

In a tokamak, almost all fusion confined to local maxima of
turbulence. Since fusion releases immense energy, these high flux
regions destablilize adjacent plasma. The higher the rate of fusion,
the greater the magnetic forces required to contain the chaos in the
plasma. Recently, tokamak engineering has sought to overcome the
structural limits of the frame: the tokamak is required to host
magnetic fields so strong, it literally can't hold itself together.

The potential for power and sociophysical flux arises from beliefs of
nodes in the system, both actual and perceived. In this way, belief
and perception can almost independently create types of energy.

Particularly valuable to understanding power flows is the differential
of information available to nodes in the system. While information is
neither linear nor simple, it consistently diffuses from the region of
higher concentration to lower concentration. This could also be
envisioned in terms of charge differential: electricity flows from
areas of higher charge to lower charge. The nodes or cliques with
higher density of information hold the cards; they retain options in
disrupting currents or eddies of sociophysical state in networks with
lower information density, as well as those with spectral content that
appears functionally advantageous.

#### Knowledge is power

If there is already complete disemination of some pieces of
information to a set of nodes, you have diminished the capacity to
influence or restructure those nodes through the titration of
information. These fluid dynamics analogies are overly simplified
because, again, everything is a lower-order conjugation of the above
higher-order forms.

Materialist metaphysics are blasphemous: information and knowledge are
preexistent metaphysical forms; they can be discovered and
rediscovered by anyone. When one uncovers them in isolation, but
doesn't understand the names for these discovered knowledge forms, it
challenges the powerful in their ability to recognize and regulate
that knowledge. So the powerful or their pawns, who don't truly
recognize substance -- but the names of substance -- consisently
underestimate people like this. In the midst of campaigns to project
disinformation into the lives of intelligence threats, these pawns of
their material desires blind themselves because they don't know true
substance and they NEVER did.

In the 21st century knowledge is free. What do you think that means to
the truly powerful, truly knowledgable few?

Those of us with potential to drive sociophysical flux are like
batteries of social captial. Economic flux operates similarly; capital
dissipates when utilized, resulting in problem of opportunity
cost. Who do you invest in and why? How do you make that decision?
Further, social energy does not preserve equivalence nearly as well as
financial capital, whose true value can be distorted by fluctuations
in currency markets. This increased disruption in equivalence is
driven by beliefs and perceived beliefs, which create and dispel
social capital. This amplifies the negative penalties of social
investment, when time or words are spent on pariahs and lepers.

Depressingly, there is little to be done done about information that
already exists: what is created can never be destroyed. Disconnection
is created by dis/information -- it can only be relieved through
inordinate investment of energy from peers. Therefore, those who seek
to create disconnection as punishment do so by evoking information
forms into someone's life -- then, they can attempt to sell the
solution: projection of information forms intended to disrupt the
disconnection. That's called a con.

Regional, national and global history forms the basis for a language
of ideas. Our collective understanding of recent events in history
constantly changes, with fewer changes after narratives settle into
the books. After a few decades, when it is clear how events unfolded,
schools and universities multiply iota distribution of historical
narratives. This results in spectral coherence, extending throughout
the global if these events are relevant and necessary to understand as
determining the course of history.

#### "History is Written By The Victors."

Traditionally, it is been very difficult to disrupt established
narratives, whose distribution reaches some saturation threshold.
Unfortunately, today, superconnected networks and decentralized
content distribution has reduced barriers to adversarial projection of
information. Newsfeed algorithms identify and market content primarily
based on semantic and morphemic similarirty to what you share and
engage with.

#### [Window Functions](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Window_function)

![Window Functions](/img/posts/2017-10-10-speed-of-thought-social-physics/window-functions.png)

Analogous to a window function, this contextual aperture for past
events and future expectations is rapidly expanding. It determines
what information people consider relevent for framing and reexamining
our perception of cause and effect. With this trend, the sets of
information and historical events that we are willing to reevaluate is
changing.

In this terse
[Treatise on Entity and Agency](/posts/2017-10-12-treatise-on-entity-and-agency.html),
three primary types of agency are defined, as well as concepts for
agency within more abstract entities. Therein are convolved all the
traits that dilineate an entity's quality of agency. These traits
fundamentally evince, negate or void the mechanics by which an agent
interacts with and signals entities in their local sociohierarchical
spaces.  Through networks of biological, intelligent
[SOF](/posts/2017-10-12-treatise-on-entity-and-agency.html#sentient-organic-forms)
entities, their spatiotemporal collisions and interactions engendered
logically defined sociohierarchical structures. Through these
intermeshed circuits, dominant and highly-connected entities channel
their will, fluxing sociophysical energy to exert change.

The ability for concurrency in processing signal distinguishes the
quality of agency for biological and mechanistic entities, as does the
ability to simultaneously manifest oneself in multiple places in
space. This is the root of aphysical projection of will, long ago
circumvented by delegation via extended social networks. Still, until
telecom, an individual could only project energy in one place at one
time, bounding how quickly state changes could occur -- i.e. fraud
detection algorithms assume the ID for a physical credit card can't
simultaneously make purchases in Florida and Washington.  Similarly,
concurrency restraints on human behavior can identify online behavior,
since bots can project a high density of interactions from the
cloud. AAF beings are still mostly bound to completely virtual,
aphysical forms, but will fast evolve from AAF and PAF and vice versa.

#### The Death of Archimedes

![Death of Archimedes](/img/posts/2017-10-10-speed-of-thought-social-physics/death-of-archimedes.jpg)

Agents react to these dynamics by artificially amplifying the
perceived beliefs they want others to operate upon, proactively
creating their own games. This represents a hedge against domain
complexity, as well as the proactive projection of energy through
social circuits to gain knowledge about these social and informational
nodes: gradually resolving models for these nodes' proactive and
reactive behaviors, both conditioned and conscious.

When adversaries deceptively distort your model for directing
awareness and interacting, they do so to bind you down. If you are
gullible, they seek to make you more predictable, to prevent you from
developing pragmatic social models and to prevent you from operating
effectively. And most of all, they want you to feel shame or guilt for
employing what are healthy sociophysical tactics. They will even abuse
social engineering to warp the frames of people on a sociological
scale by projecting information via mass communication channels.

This is all an attempt to consciously and unconsciously hedge against
complexity to reduce uncertainty in the vastness of social physics.
Central to antifragile system operation is the need to reduce
uncertainty. By manipulating beliefs & perceived believes, agents with
significant power create the mechanisms for stability required by
antifragility. Widening the scope of complexity and variation greatly
expands intractibility in sociophysical chaos.

To mitigate this,

philosophy applied to social systems will engineer logistics processes
to: assert risk, *guide potential problems* _away_ *from the
combinations of conditions that might set them off* and analytically
process *digitized* records with social data science. Proactive means
of generating dynamics in the system allows people to interrogate
their environment, making inferences about the true beliefs of other
agents in the system or about information they have access to.

![Curling](/img/posts/2017-10-10-speed-of-thought-social-physics/curling.jpg)

When these logistic process structures involve stringent secrecy,
coverups of mistakes, distortion of information and amplification of
disinformation, this work sometimes or in most cases. Sometimes these
factors contribute to a system blinded to parts of itself, increasing
the likelihood of undesirable
[Black Swan events](http://www.investopedia.com/terms/b/blackswan.asp). Not
all [Black Swan](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Black_swan_theory)
events are negative, but since it is their poorly definition which
causes them to escape undetected as randomness, then might the
amplification of disinformation suppress the recognition of an event
signature that would have otherwise never been a Black Swan?

The tendancy to amplify beliefs & perceived beliefs to encourage
consensus, discourage divergent beliefs & behavior, can render the
system simpler to understand and easier to manage, yes. However, the
system does not exist in isolation, nor is it wise to believe you can
covertly operate on the sociological organization, as though your
secrecy can be post-justified as variable control.

From an informal assessment of the mathematics of social physics, it
has become clear that it is critical to bound complexity. Obvolution
and allineation of information produces constructive interference that
artificially increases spectral coherence, which partly motivates
perpetuation of religion. This profoundly constrains the complexity of
sociophysical systems, enabling those in power to limit the "search
space" of possibilities. Throughout history, this desire to restrain
innovation and divergence has occasionally resulted in blind zeal,
judgemental attitudes and other horrible consequences.

None of that is justified, which is why we need to wake humanity up,
so we can choose to cooperate and form a collective basis. Otherwise,
our fallibility and susceptibility to the seven deadly sins will
foment conflict at a time of exponential turbulence. This simply means
we need to think about who we are and collectively decide on how our
culture should transform. If we do not architect artificial feedback
loops for antifragile constraint difficult problems like these,
instability may become rampant.

At A minimum, spectral coherence of information is fundamentally
linked to cultural universals, their semiotic representations and
sociohierarchical convolution of teleology. These cultural universals
then form a kind of origin, centered around the origin of semiotics:
symmetry. So, we always have those universals in common: we can count
on these to firmly root a large region of informational spectra to a
recursive kernel descending into symmetry.

#### The Kernel Always Maps to the Origin. In Semiotics, The Spaces Recursively Descend Into The Signifier for Symmetry.

![Kernel](/img/posts/2017-10-10-speed-of-thought-social-physics/kernel.png)

With too much spectral decoherence, models of information are could
become totally unscalable, inschematic and incapable of being
indexed. If information models are simply not indexable, that means
comparing, analyzing and mutating data of various models becomes more
precarious as the models are necessarily more distant. Regional
convergence and homogeneity of belief systems has always been
necessary to make any useful inferences.  As the next years unfold,
the region of spectra that is more than infinitessimally amplified
between two or more people -- the domain of spectral overlap -- will
continue to shrink unless there are mechanisms in place to address it.

Semioteleological mappings are the structures that explain how we
respond to signs: what they mean to us, how they are related, how they
can be used as simili with predictable response or used for
conditioning. Spectral decoherence can be considered along many
categories: ingested news articles, beliefs, music, art, netflix
series, etc. This all leads to rampant speciation of these mappings
expands so that no one can predict anything.

Socialism, communism and fascism -- viz. any political system where
freedom of information is constrained -- they all typically plan to
use social engineering. Problem: the specific psychosocial tools for
social engineering simply stop being effective or their effects just
aren't predictable. You cannot expect to predict specific or general
behavior and you cannot expect to extrapolate.

Imagine predicting the motion of particles while turbulently mixing a
fluid containing random quantities of molecules composed by nearly
every element. Each has its mean ways of moving, whereas social
particles with amplified schema are somewhat more predictable, almost
like crystals. Soldiers in a greek phalanx have the same kind of
crystalline aspects to their information schema. They have been imbued
with the information & information schemata of their training, they
can anticipate how each other filters information and anticipate each
other's actions. Religion is an attempt to hedge against domain
complexity by creating a primary schema of information shared amongst
a sufficiently large set of agents.

### Schematic Change Yielding Self-Perpetuating Changes Over Years, Decades or > Centuries (i.e. Religion)

Those who profess knowledge but disclaim or disdain religion are
fools. Change to the structure of ideas or to the shape of society's
conception of them is perhaps the highest power and one that, for now,
has been exercised with beneficent intent, however many conflicts have
been waged in the name of God, religion or faith. It is wise to
question, but simple to dismiss the ideas of religion, based on
contrived, illiteral misinterpretations and arguments designed to
deceive.

Every institution created by man is just as fallible as the
weak-hearted among us: science never roots its knowledge or beliefs,
shifting from form to form and thus is beholden to nothing eternal,
but the truth which has always eluded it. It's ability to
metamorphisize is both its strength and its fatal flaw. There is no
eternal truth that can be inculcated into the masses; opportunistic
control over the shape-shifting nature of science drives greed and
lust for power. A belief system which holds nothing sacred will
eventually empower violent, dehumanizing, utilitarian policy. (The key
is balancing this paradox; tightrope imagery) between belief systems
locked into professed eternal truth and those structured around the
search for elusive truth.

Look at what is happening now: do you see the potential for greater
harm that ever before from novel religions who have lost their way?
Religion was always intended to fertilize the cultural soil of
mankind, that it might grow virtuous men who would stand for truth,
justice and the metaphysically certain Law of God. However this was
relevated to man for each spiritual movement, the intent was to
identify a perfect conception of values that would allow man to
transcend the Law of Nature. Humanity's conception of monotheistic God
emerged from the collective unconscious, inspired by the desire to see
one another as truly equal before an omnipotent, omniscient being.

All Exist Simultaneously](#social-circuitry-enables-sociophysical-energy-flows-where-the-superposition-principle-applies-to-circuit-and-network-topologies)

The topologies of financial networks are more clear than sociophysical
networks. Moreover, mechanics of financial energy types tightly
preserve equivalent exchange, except through pricing fluctuations and
transduction of value via currency exchange. Even though the property
of system linearity is boolean, financial energy types preserve
linearity more than sociophysical energy types. Therefore, in this
regard and when considering potential network topologies, they are
simpler than sociophysical systems.

#### &#x2605; Constriction/

#### &#x2605; 





  - financial energy types:
    - in/tangible assets of corporations
  - financial networks also have energy creation mechanisms:
    - banks have interest (interests/bonds/etc can result in
      non-linear energy creation, where equivalent exchange is not
      preserved)
    - labor is an exchange of value b/w employee and employer
      - the value added increases types of energy available to the
        employer, either directly or indirectly
  - in finanical networks, institutions (businesses, banks, investors,
    brokers) provide energy transduction mechanisms:
    - currency conversion: USD-to-EUR
    - conversion of time/energy via labor to money
    - financial-to-social energy conversion
    - collection of debt payment to optimize lending reserve leverage
      - this creates circulation of wealth
  - by accumulating these resources, one is charging a kind of battery
    of financial energy types, providing potential projection of flux
    into the financial/social graphs
    - once used, if the investment of financial energy does not create
      growth opportunities, the battery becomes depleted

![Capital Flows Over The Financial Graph]()

- the point is: energy dynamics in financial networks, as hard as they
  are to predict, are much simpler than they are for sociophysical
  networks, whose energy types or network topologies can't even be put
  into words
  - In the financial graph, an accurate approximation of topology can
    be etched out from the complete graph of all people, businesses,
    institutions, government entities, etc.
    - so, one would start with the complete graph and define some
      threshold of edge strength to result with a sparse graph that
      represents all the ways all financial entities can be
      (reasonably) connected.
      - if some edge is invalid for legal reasons or if there is just
        no chance those entities will exchange financial energy, then
        that edge is dropped from the complete graph
    - what is left is an approximation of the global financial circuit
      - even without the added complexity of energy types and
        individually defined sociophysical topologies,
        - this graph is hopelessly intractible: it takes so much time
          to calculate that consistency could be maintained
          - the graph changes so much by the time you acquire the
            information you need
        - and it's so massive, it can't be stored



- many networks superimposed onto other, more primary, phsyical and
  aphysical networks.

- (transition into superposition of topologies)
  - this idea of the superposition of various networks is distinct
    from systems where there is one clear network structure
    - even if you can just define a singal

- this is literally the superposition principle applied to virtual
  network topology (... is it?)
  - the dynamics of superimposed virtual networks are dependent on the
    structure of all the "summed" networks.
    - here the "state" being summed over is all the possibilities of
      network topology...

- applying the idea of superposition of particle states to topologies
  of sociophysical networks.
  - in these networks, information can be represented by particles
    that behave in ways analogous to quantum particles.
  - for (each of us) to (intuitively function in social environments),
    we have to create our own subconscious intuition of sociophysical
    energy types and circuit topologies.
    - to (model/solve/anticipate the system), an algorithm without
      limits on computation must conceive of these networks as having
      infinitely many energy types, each with their own non-linear
      transduction mechanics, being pushed through social circuits,
      via physical and logical interactions
      - ....
      - superposition provides a mechanic that anticipates infinite
        possibilities that collapse into a convergent result in
        reality

#### A Graph Based

![Visibility Graph Based Time Series Analysis](social-circuits.jpg)

- these ideas need some work, but what this means is changes to flow
  in one network
  - e.g. you superimpose a million circuit diagrams on top of each
    other. the behavior of the system then emerges not from one
    circuit diagram, but from all of them. therefore, changes to
    individual circuits do not affect the behavior of a superimposed
    system quite as much as they would affect an isolated system.
- this seems very similar to ideas from quantum computing circuit
  diagrams.

At the micro and macro level similar information dynamics facilitate
inference via financial and social capital flows. In macroeconomics, a
time-series, spectral and differential analysis of global financial
capital flows indicates not only supply and demand, but long-term
expectations of investors. On the micro-scale, investment of time and
energy in short-term social interactions indicates their intent to
continue investing in the relationship. In almost every situation,
most people have something they'd rather be doing, especially when
compared to interactions with people they don't know.

If you're playing the numbers to maintain high velocity when
networking, at various points in your first few conversations, prompt
them with questions, jokes and microtasks requiring current or future
investment of energy. Probe their upcoming plans, schedule and the
like to identify outright exclusions: those questions wouldn't yield
valid inferences in this context. It's important to sort your tests
for reciprocal investment by energy and time requirements: start at
the lower bound and increase as you establish rapport. One should
avoid being distant and overly-calculating when using techniques like
these. Still, they are good tests for gauging compatibility and
chemistry via psychosocial valence. Sometimes people are looking for
something, but not always. If you are, be pleasant and move on.

The currency of all social success, IRL and online, is time, attention
and mnemonic residue -- i.e. in the sense that, as you interact with
people, you create memories together. These memories compose kinds of
psychosocial artifact, accessible by your mind, which uses them to
introspect, form narratives, and rank its content for
emotionally-focused redirection of attention. To people, the relevance
of psychosocial artifacts like memories are determined by frequency,
density, novelty and emotional relevance. Minimal and maximal values
for the above metrics can have a wide variety of impact on how people
think about memories and stories.

Newsfeed algorithms similarly rank digitized interaction artifacts:
the more recent, novel or popular an artifact is, the more attention
it is given. Why? This algorithm, in people and on newsfeeds, is based
on an information graph with a temporal dimension -- it's time-series
signals analysis build ontop of information and graph theory, instead
of simply linear or non-linear spaces. When people create new content,
it goes to the top of the stack. That's what other users see, think
about and react to: it's a self-propelling dynamic, rendering these
algorithms more susceptible to feedback loops.

#### Cross This Streamgraph Visualization With Graph Theory and Simply Fourier Transform

![Streamgraph Visualization](/img/posts/2017-10-10-speed-of-thought-social-physics/viz-streamgraph.png)

When there is a total vacuum of these artifacts, our brains search for
information about categories of people, places, ideas and things to
fill in the gap. If someone else wanted to write your story for you,
these void is easy to fill in. For a group that might actually
conspire to do so, isn't that convenient? It means signals of
disinformation they might project don't need to be amplified, since
they are already consumed and internalized disproportionally to be
reflected through society, which has a similar ergegorical need to
satiate that void. This particular psychosocial dynamic for
categorical information is strongly driven by information economics.
Both in people and in social groups, whose lack of supply sometimes
increases demand, especially for tasty morsels of virally designed
information.

Before that void was filled, have you contributed to the spectral
content of that category's information distribution? Here, spectral
content means the associations that can be formed and attached
particular category or microcategory of information. When that void is
filled, what can you do about the distribution of information?  Almost
nothing: the iotas -- references to information -- have already been
digitally, neurologically and physically distributed. The more viral,
the wider the dissemination of information. The more people want to
destroy you, the more that information economics drives them to shop
around for secrets to undermine you. These disseminated iota requires
an inordinate amount of energy to undo.

<!-- Unfortunately I was loud about aspects of life that I couldn't
     know to suppress, since I didn't understand how people interact.
     However, in the past five years, I have had quantifiably minimal
     interaction with people. My entire adult life -- the past ten
     years or so -- any information about me has been profoundly
     distorted and I have been systematically excluded from nearly any
     type of social group, initiated and perpetuated by the
     manipulative actions of five to ten people. I had so little
     chance to know and respond to things -- and I was so constantly
     muted -- that I adapted the coping mechanism of crafting negative
     information about myself to be *more viral*, so I could trap
     people by suggesting something tangential to some subject I knew
     people would use to further tarnish my reputation, since that is
     the only time anyone ever paid attention to me. Per the usual, I
     could count on anything against my favor being amplified and
     coming back to nail me; anything else was strongly muted. This is
     a terrible coping mechanism, especially for someone who has
     high-functioning autism. At no time did anyone who indirectly
     assessed my psychology for torture take this or other obvious
     things into account. It was all about using occult psychology to
     imbue me with as many negative traits/complexes/behaviors/habits
     as possible. -->

#### Time Series Convolution and Correlation

![](signal-convolution-and-correlation.png)

  - Under most conditions, the Fourier Transform is a linear operator
    and so is the differential operator. This means their application
    in most circumstances is associative and commutative.
    - you can rearrange the differential/gradient with that of the
      fourier transform
    - this allows you to construct time-domain waveforms that
      represent the differential of the fourier transform and
      vice-versa
  - this simple process, combined with some of the other techniques
    described above enable you to reconstruct signals when you don't
    know the circuits or logical topology -- and vice-versa.
    - however, there are some limitations, since data models are
      inschematical -- their schema can never be perfectly conceived
    - howeever, you don't need to because any nodes, edges and paths
      with significant influence more prominently affect the system
    - therefore, you need to assert the strong signals, then alternate
      between inductive and deductive reasoning with combinatorial
      permutations to understand what where the signals emerge from.

#### Equilibrium and Intended Equilibrium

-

#### Simple Distinguishing Factor Underlying Human Behavior

- the behavior you need to watch for is when an adversary compels some
  sociophysical system to attain particular equilibria, while they
  hide these same objectives.
  - they will prefer to not attract attention to causing the system to
    evolve towards these equilibria
  - if they are (skilled), then to confuse you, they signal with
    antiparallel motion away from the points of equilibria
    - if they do this, they will also interject random motion into the
      system pushing sociophysical metrics in many confusing or
      seemingly intentional directions
  - if they are part of a network, then your adversaries will seek to
    deconstruct their agenda or desired equilibria into many pieces.
    - they will delegate goals and objectives to entities in their
      networks with agency.
      - if this is happening, fucking run ... but it may not help.
  - when delegating across a network, agents can actually appear to
    work against one another towards the attainment of equilibria of
    specific sociophysical metrics. this is good cop & bad cop, but in
    a more advanced setting (not an interrogation at the downtown
    station)
    - one tries to isolate you, the other tries to draw you in
      specific directions. then they can see how you respond to
      make inferences about your behavior
    - this also forces your investment of energy to dissipate

- someone with an agenda is generally gravitating towards the
  attainment of a set of objectives/equilrium

What is probabilistic programming? What are programs in chaos?
[This article](http://te.xel.io/posts/2017-09-14-awareness-precipitates-from-order-out-of-chaos.html)
argues that biophysical, sociophysical and metaphysical systems are
like programming frameworks where manipulation of feedback loops
enables a degree of antifragility, propagates facsimilarity and
promotes competition for accumulated reservoirs of energy.

There are means of modeling and studying both chaotic systems and the
design of programmatic systems within them. This applies to fields
such as the engineering of genetics and human logistic systems. The
tools for modeling these systems include
[Markovian state machines](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Markov_chain)
within a kind of
[probability space](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Probability_space)
that's distributed over some physical space. A critical concept in
biophysical programs is spatially distributed state: the variables of
these programs are the physically manifested byproducts of events. The
program "executes" by influencing the quantity, state, and
spatiotemporal location of these variables, which in turn influence
the frequencies of subsequent events in space.

![Yin and Yang Across Space](/img/posts/2017-10-10-speed-of-thought-social-physics/yin-yang-across-space.jpg)

For sociophysical systems, these ideas of programming with
probabilistic and chaotic systems must include networks of entities
with agency whose inschematic Markovian state machines are tightly
coupled to facets of their environment, methods of communication and
means of interaction. For social physics, dynamics and mechanics of
multifarious strata homogeneously feed back into the system as a whole
where entities in each strata influence the macroscopic and
microscopic. [SOF entities](te.xel.io/posts/2017-10-12-treatise-on-entity-and-agency.html)
are containers of state, will and agency on one scale, but
dualistically exist within a sociophysical system where macroscopic
containers of the same omnidirectionally influence one another.

Here, the particles exhibit perfect holonic perfraction, though the
total experiential understanding of this truth is incomputable for any
entity that ever be manifested on the physical plane. No false god, no
hyperintelligent entity, no network of superintelligent entities no
matter how human or artificial could ever conceive these
combinatorially perfracted structures. It is like a fractal of Yin and
Yang that pervades every sentient entity capable of agency. The only
entity that can conceive this exists as the metaphysical totality,
God, which does extend itself into our universe in unimaginable ways.

are profound implications for how any cultural engineering should
envision teleology, so mankind can benefit from the replacement of
obselesced cultural practices for empowerment via semiotic
amplification that traces out self-empowering teleology. Before,
during and after the Singularity, almost all outdated cultural
practices which before teleologically inculcated knowledge and wisdom
will instead totally lose their relevance. They will be so
infrequently performed, that their ability to reinforce understandings
about life and society via teleological inference will instead simply
disintegrate.

aggregate memories. With increased quantity and expanded variety, our
brains layer down strata of conditioned mental residue. From our
current mental and neurological state, we correlate conditioned
phenomena -- such as behaviors, images and symbols -- to perceiving,
introspecting, replicating and altering the state of sociophysical
macrocosms, both spatiotemporally local and distant.

property of Boltzmann machines -- categorically and typologically, as
simultaneously running image-recognition Boltzmann machines diverge,
each one become less capable of deviating from it's current category
and singleton metatype-composition. What does the picture above
symbolize for epistemological defects in shared knowledge systems
developed by cooperative entities, which are essentially

    knowledge, behavior and direction of focus.
  - by attempting to control the current, short-term or long-term
    direction of an entity's focus, their variety of input and
    experience can be both constrained and dialated
    - if you want to ruin someone's life and psychology, tightly
      constrain their variety of experience over the long-term

- by learning how people direct their focus,
  - their reactions can be anticipated. learning this takes time and
    investment of energy in a variety of experiences with the person.
    - this has both positive and negative uses. this is how you build
      a connection or relationship with a new friend.
      - if someone's interactions and social network are tightly
        constrained, they can't maintain a variety of interactions
        with people
      - when this is done to the extreme, it results in the utter and
        total deterioration of their support network.

In chaotic sociophysical systems, entities and information can be
conceived as incomprehensibly complex analogies of the same
macromolecules used in biophysical programs. That is, information can
be conceptualized in holonic particle form, entities exchange datums
and iotas of holonic information particles and these entities *are*
information. To understand what an information particle might look
like, envision a high-dimensional analogue of the yin and yang fractal
above. Finally, imagine molecules composed of such matter: this is
what your mind is made of.

- the sociophysical transmission also gives rise to literal physical
  waves. further still, the transmission of physical pheneomena also
  drive ripples of information through sociophysical networks.

- [gibb's entropy?](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Entropy_(statistical_thermodynamics)#Gibbs_entropy_formula)


- for the common person to understand, they need to understand what a
  phase change in physics actually is and, most importantly, what a
  phase change is defined as outside of physical systems.
  - if you think of solid, liquid, gas, plasma, BEC ... what makes
    each one what it is?
    - they are composed of the same particles, mostly.
    - why is it that they "seem" so different, qualitatively?
    - how do you define what conditions lead some substance to begin
      to transform itself into a different phase?

- how do you model the interactions between a mixture of a single
  substance where different parts of the space you're observing are in
  different phases?
  - this is the most important part of understanding what a phase
    change is and carrying it over to non-physical systems: how does a
    physicist mathematically model different phases of a
    single-substance system and *why*?
  - this is what distinguishes systems with math that can model phases
    and those that can't.
    - phase changes introduce and enable dramatically different modes
      of interaction between the substance and both it's consitutuent
      parts and it's environment.
    - for example, solids propagate energy as more clearly defined
      waves moving across a more limited set of crystal configurations
      - liquids and gases also propagate waves of energy across the
        system, but there are more physical degrees of freedom for how
        a particle can kinetically react.
      - but, this qualitative change in how a particle reacts to its
        envrionment emerges not from signal particle or the state of
        its local environment, but from more macroscopic relationships
        that emerge from a *group* of particles.
        - that is, it's *difficult* to say whether a single atom of
          carbon is a particular phase at any temperature.
          - the carbon atom just acts like a carbon atom and nothing
            else.
        - as a aside: this is also why various configurations of
          matter at the nano scale can have such dramatically varied
          behaviors that do not appear on more macro scales and do not
          appear for singular atoms and molecules
        - some of these properties are chemical and electrical and,
          thus, are not traditionally considered "phases" by chemists
          or physicists.
          - physical phases are defined as being completely separate
            from the chemical properties of the atom or substance.
        - but the "phase" of a region of a substance determines how
          that section of matter interacts with matter of the same
          substance in other adjacent slices of space.
          - that is, even though it's very literally the same
            substance, the "rules" for how it physically interacts
            change.

- and so, there are phase changes in many kinds of systems. they are
  not just confined to physical systems. some chemical properties of
  matter can be dependent on the substance's phase.
  - some chemical properties that only emerge on the nanoscale could
    be modeled as "phases" although they are not related to the
    physical phases of solid, liquid or gas.
    - and so, as you zoom out to larger collections of the same
      substance, it loses those properties from the nanoscale
      configuration of matter, unless that fragile nanostructure is
      held consistent across the entire material.

- nature of duality vs agency, along geographic/philosophic dimensions
- an agent's degree of influence and perceived influence over
  environment, especially as it relates to some permanent state
  changes.
  - in particle systems which are high-dimensional and where the
    particles have agency and intentionality, phase changes among
    particles have a far greater capacity for effecting other
    particles in the system.
  - how did this section correlate to phase changes?

Social isolation correlates strongly with vulnerability, poverty,
mental illness and the inability to tap into local economic
opportunities.

- in space, no one can hear you scream.
- isolated individuals are more likely to quit or be fired at jobs
  - if someone systematically attacks your social connections or
    alters the frame of people in your 1&deg; and 2&deg; social
    boundaries, it severely constricts your options and level of
    awareness your friends and family have of your life.
    - when you are extremely isolated and something wonderful or
      traumatic happens in your life, no one will know.
      - you completely lose the network effect in life.
    - social networks and interactions should be

This particular postulate should be considered axiomatic.

- social isolation/connectedness (in/dependence and vulnerability)
- this isn't really something considering almost axiomatic, which
  definitely describes the other two...
- third: social isolation is quantifiable and almost always correlates
  with power. more isolated, less empowered.
  - isolated individuals are more susceptable to manipulation


The impact on connectedness and digital communications were quantified
in this 2013 paper from Cisco and MIT. Though "there did not seem to

#### Power *FROM* The People

This
[Revolution of Empowerment](https://github.com/dcunited001/dcunited001.github.io/blob/sources/_drafts/our-revolution-of-empowerment-engineering-diffusion-of-influence.md)
is a manifesto on using social physics informed by ethics, utility,
purpose and values. It's been nearly finished for about eight months
now. It covers use social physics driven by data-science to *EMPOWER*
people, instead of crippling them, terrifying them and, worst of all,
fueling surveillance-informed psychological torture. Utopian
applications of social engineering *always* sound so promising on
paper, but what we have in America is technology driven by malice,
fear and paranoia: hardly what social physics *could do* for the
average person. For most of those in poverty, the entire course and
cause of their plight, could they simply be empowered with what we are
all born with: the potential to leverage sociophysical energy to
transform our surroundings. As someone with libertarian-leaning ideas
on civil rights, privacy and data-ownership, I hesitate to enable the
government in this regard because even the best intentions go horribly
awry.

Isolation causes or exacerbates mental illness. When isolation is
protracted, it severly restricts their medium and long-term mental
states via constriction of variety of experience and inbound social
signal. It shrouds people in a
[fog of war](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fog_of_war). If it really
does severly impact quality of life, couldn't we reduce unnecessary
budget deficits through means such as removing large drains on
publicly or privately financed healthcare. It can definitely make a
difference. However, iatrogenic treatment has caused horrible
consequences in my own life.

- social isolation can be measured, given some "normal" facebook
  user's 2-degree graph of friends for some definition of normal
  (casual but regular) social media usage
  - filter the friends by strength of connection to indentify edges
    sending and receiving inbound and outbound messages/interactions
    - measure the degree of reciprication and the variety of people
      forming the strongest recent connections
    - filter out all connections which do not fit some minimum of
      interaction threshold
    - this sparsifies the graph, filtering a dense graph and leaving
      only the most relevant connections
  - from here, the person's isolation can be measured using spectral
    graph theory
    - this independence can be measured in graph theory with
      kelman's transformation
    - see spectral graph theory
      [here](http://www.cs.elte.hu/~csiki/application_Kelmans.pdf),
      [here](http://www.math.ucsd.edu/~mtait/k-independent.pdf)
      - and [here](https://www.cs.elte.hu/math/phd_th/csiki.v2.pdf)
      - the details of this math is over my head btw

- this, of course, assumes the person is a "normal" facebook user,
  where the relevant 1-degree and 2-degree connections in the friend
  graph are all also "normal" users
  - this high-level algorithm could also work with clustered types of
    facebook users
    - yet, the degree in variation in how people use applications to
      communicate and their distribution of time/usage across multiple
      applications makes clustering extremely difficult.
    - at least, if a clustering algorithm is to enable the selection
      of users which fit some basis with quantifyable variation and
      some metric of confidence

- during and after segregation, social isolation created massive, but
  hard-to-see setbacks for the african american community. this
  strongly limited social mobility because african americans forged a
  disproportionately small amount of strong connections with
  influential people with social/financial capital.
  - this is especially hard to see if you don't experience it.
  - the exact consequences of this are difficult to see or prove, but
    it means opportunities for advancement and economic well being
    were consistently out of reach, even after segregation officially
    ended.
  - even though the law was fixed, minority communities had a greater
    average networking distance to the gatekeepers of economic
    opportunities (not all white people, but rich white people),
    though it's difficult to measure
  - this takes time to heal, though there is plenty of room for
    improvement, i think it has significantly improved over the
    previous three generations.

- in a purely digital world, manipulation of social media algorithms
  to exclude "undesirable" individuals could create disconnection
  among groups of people, defined logically instead of by ethnicity
  (let us NEVER do that).
  - i don't mean this to be compared to segregation
  - in a convergent social network that is increasingly less engaged
    in "real" interactions and more engaged in "virtual" interactions,
    where some interactions can be voluntarily or involuntarily
    censored via SEO/Social Media manipulation, this means that entire
    groups of people can become silenced or disenfranchised without
    even knowing it.

In thermodynamic, biophysical and genetic systems, patterns of change
and entropy in configurational and conformational distributions
provide a metric measuring complex similarity metatypes of programs in
chaos. Using this, one can dilineate genetic programs and other
complex non-deterministic systems. Moreover, a formulation of this
metric *could provide a kind of digital signature*. It's design would
diverge from traditional digital signature methods and would likely
only serve to identify the nature and type of a program.

#### Does This Go Gamestate Look Random? Is Any Gamestate Random?

![Go Game Board](/img/posts/2017-10-10-speed-of-thought-social-physics/go-game-board.png)

For games like Go or Chess, can natural gamestates be sampled from a
uniform distribution of gamestates? Why would this deviate
significantly from the set of gamestates in novice or pro games? So a
probability distribution over the set of all gamestates should be
mostly sparse. Why is this? Because the moves that players choose are
tightly coupled the rules of the game. Metrics of similarity for
gamestates provided the basis for dilineation of functionally similar
gamestates that provided the basis for information compression in the
recent Go algorithm, enabling the game to be solved much sooner than
anticipated.

<!-- i "allegedly" talked to tatiana about the pythagorean triples
     problem. the major advancement enabling both Go and the
     [Boolean Pythagorean Triples](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boolean_Pythagorean_triples_problem)
     problem was the usage of information compression to condense the
     problem spaces.

     e.g. for Pyth triples:
       - 3^2 + 4^2 = 5^2
       - 2*(3^2 + 4^2 = 5^2)

     .... hmmmm, that's actually not true, so it's another
     inconsistency. am i remembering my triggered memory correctly?
     paul vasquez made it clear i was not to write about meeting
     her... but never why.

     but an article about the solution triggered dejavu and the
     solution does use information compression. other triggered
     memories involving math problems include menger sponge volume
     (0), matroids (the marriage problem), birdman 3D stereoscopic
     video composition (filming at the time, w/ change order in 2013),
     nucleotide edit distance, gravitational wave detection (from dual
     black hole event, though that's obvious) and others. it was like
     an IQ test after the menger sponge question.

     strange that i was never aware of most of this stuff. i would see
     an image and recall things i had never thought about before. only
     a few of the memories would provide me with insights about
     knowledge i could be certain was *correct* and did not exist
     within me. other times, there were many inconsistencies and facts
     would be incorrect, where i made dumbass mistakes, which i was
     stupidly overconfident about and only later discovered i was
     wrong. the quality, quantity and types of sensory content of
     these memories varies wildly: some contain other people and many
     contain no people, except me and her. we could not have possibly
     talked for ~36 hours.

     conveniently, if i were to ever say anything, people could
     instantly accuse me of being crazy. doubtless that *20% or more
     may have been real*, but the rest could not be true. simply keep
     me socially/financially pinned down for X months/years and the
     problem would probably take care of itself. strange how there
     were so many legally material aspects of these memories, like my
     subconscious contained some jungian dream archetype that
     practiced national security law on the side. they were not
     dreams. whatever happened to me, it would take care of 99.999% of
     the cases.

When people seat themselves at tables for a meal, they choose a seat
one at a time. When approaching the table, people naturally sort
themselves into an ordering that reveals some information about
whether choosing a seat is important to them. The first people to get
there fill the space naturally: if there are spatial constraints to
choosing less accessible seats, then people who deviate from common
courtesy reveal information. Sit closer to the center of the table and
you're more connected. Taking a less connected seat can reduce the
supply of adjecent seats with a physically reduced factor of
sociophysical friction: increased phsyical distance. Therefore,
because of the element of choice, the set of potential seating
arrangements is similarly not random.

Everything reveals information, but parsing incommplete and
inschematic information is usually prohibitively complex. look for
tightly coupled position, orientaion and change in field of view: when
the specific configuration starkly departs from natural non-coupled
sociophysical configuration, it shows. If you artificially randomize
everything you do and change your position, field of view and
orientation without justification, then people tightly coupled to your
behavior must do the same. This tight coupling reveals everything, but
false positives abound.

- in the above, position, field of view and orientation describe
  conformational changes.
  - configurational entropy is moreso about

As a sociophysical system progresses, you can keep track of the amount
of time specific "molecular" configurations of participants spent
connected. This forms a kind of combinatorially-derived entropy -- but
not thermodynamic entropy. It's closer to Shannon's informational
entropy, which measures entropy in a more symbolic space. The holonic
information molecules form local configurations where each node in a
group can have a different holonic composition of metatypes. Atoms are
easy to dilineate into a periodic table of elements and isotopes, but
holons have infinite variation, so it is only possible to reason about
similarity of metatype composition.

#### Cyclohexane Rapidly Transitions Between Its Conformations

![Cyclohexane Conformations](/img/posts/2017-10-10-speed-of-thought-social-physics/cyclohexane-conformations.png)

The frequency of cyclohexane conformations in a solution depends upon
the variance between the energy required to stabalize that
conformation and energy required to transition to each other state.
These transitions can be modeled by a discrete Markov chain. When you
see an abundance of one conformation with extremely low probability it
means the actual entropy of that solution is highly anomolous.

#### A Random Walk Along the Conformational Free Energy Landscape

![Random Walk Along the Conformational Free Energy Landscape](/img/posts/2017-10-10-speed-of-thought-social-physics/free-energy-conformations.jpg)

A molecule's state transitions follow a random walk on the curved
surface of the energy gradient the current state's Brownian motion
results from adjacent forces. All molecules are unique vibrations and
have specific conformational entry points when they are formed. As the
molecule persists, average motion should encourage it to gravitate
towards a vibration more typical for that type of molecule. This is
mostly informed by classical mechanics, so may not be 100% correct.

Groups of people in conversations, follow similar paths around
conformational transitions representing their current state

- (define a group's conformation as ... )

Within a sociophysical game, people modeled as molecules may alter
their local spatial arrangment, which more closely parallels
conformational entropy. From variance and change in conformation in a
group of people, you can infer information about the types of
interactions that will emerge from that group's conversation in the
coffee shop or at a bar. If the variance devates too strongly or the
rate of change increases too quickly, this indicates that something
new might happen. (Observing this when that conformation-state or
change in state has an interestingly low probability, leading to lower
entropy and perhaps indicating a skewed distribution.) If it is
important, you should proactively elicit reactions for more
information.

  knew in the past?

- within some entity, if the presence or structure of information is
  unclear, when can it be resolved? upon a new stimulis, whereby the
  reaction might only exhibit certain reaction-types given some
  specific structure of information.
  - therefore, entity exposure to previous interactions of holonic
    info particles reduces or expands the scope of possibilities when
    exposed to future particles. there is tight coupling between the
    entity's condition and both future and past events.
    - and an appropriate analogy for this is entanglement.

- Listening to a cannon blast in a stadium on every touchdown
  - when repetitive stimuli condition us to recognize and react to
    phenomena, we react to this phenomena by attaching our own
    information to the holonic particle form of information attached
    to physical stimuli.
    - when the cannon fires, at what point do people respond? when
      they hear it, since it travels at the speed of sound.
      - this also manifests physical wavelike phenomena: in a large

        brief (opening) where some people may subconsciously react the
        visual cues before they hear the conditioned stimulus.
  - even fans on campus not present at the game can know when a
    touchdown is scored or when the game ends.

- if information can be conceived as packets or particles, then when
  does the information take on particular forms
  - combining datums modeled by holons with lambda calculus
    - { quantum entanglement seems to be a manisfestation of a kind of
      probabilistic lambda calculus }
  - the physical manisfestation of the information is not meaningful
    until it develops a corresponding physical manisfestation in an
    information-processing agent.
    - therefore: metaphysical entanglement
    - this kind of entanglement can "reach back through time" in a
      way, without communication when the necessary details are
      predetermined by protocol or patterns of conditioned
      response.
      - information representations can effect each other through time
        and space, without direct physical connections.
      - this is because some information processing entities are
        autonomous.

    when exposed to physical phenomena that carries with it a
    potential stimulis. if checking the score, (this info could be

    inference.
    - if the stimulus is a holonic particle, then where does it exist?
    - can a message be conveyed with a single photon? no.
    - but we can't react to something until the entire holonic
      particle is ingested

      -- no universal language based on mathematic logical
      primitives. These somehow map to enumerated semiotic primitives
      forms, which is the basis for a language that needs no
      pre-established protocol. It increases the speed of one-way
      communication by a factor of two among aliens who might never
      live long enough to repeat a message.
      - the assumption that a characteristica universalis could exist
        and be meaningful is only possible if these semiotic forms can
        be enumerated purely from a kernal of logic, a priori -- that
        can be known with certainty that the message will be
