- add sections from "process theology" article on: sociological
  phenomena that results in the greatest spiritual revitalization
  humanity has seen. (There will be a rebirth of the Jungian old God),
  where instead it is not some archaic forgotten god that is
  revitalized, but the social viability, saliency and necessity of
  religious ideas themselves.
  - this (...) is a result of the impact that secularism and atheism
    have had in removing religion from culture and social
    institutions. With regard to religion and spectrally harmonious
    distributed belief, atheists and secularists have disnormalized
    belief systems -- it is this disnormalization that is creating the
    the urgent need for and indeed the very possibility of this deluge
    back towards God and spirituality.
  - there are other aspects of society that can become disnormalized.

- The Tower of Babel, whether true, false, mythological or incomplete,
  is a story about the disnormalization of language until a schism
  occurred. It is likely that this is one of the first examples of the
  Marxist dialectical being used to inform contentious rhetorical
  tactics that disrupt assumptions, facts, etc in debate/discussion by
  disrupting the networks of semantic meaning corresponding to
  morphemes. Also, wherever there is a grammar, there is the potential
  to create “shadow grammars” where alternative grammatical parsing is
  implied to the listener via abnormal inflection or intonation.

=======

- projecting/receiving belief about norms is a social process that
  helps harmonize perceived normative distritions by accelerating
  social consensus of belief about norms.
  - Reasoning about the perceived belief about norms helps someone
    conform.
  - If they are isolated from observing stimulus which project belief
    about norm and/or facilitate its consensus -- and there is more
    than bidirectional signaling at play -- then this accelerates
    their own piagetian changes in internal epistemic structure. in
    the absence of social stimuli, one's own experience and thoughts
    have more impact on their evolution in cognitive structuring,
    sub/conscious direction of attention and abstraction.
  - Also, you're receiving less information about changes in group
    consensus on norms and thus, one further deviates from group
    consensus. Furthermore, when the isolated individual has
    denormalized from social consensus, if society's genetic epistemic
    evolution is also accelerated, then thus their separation from
    normative signaling accumulates dissonance from social consensus
    at an accelerated rate. Hence, our descent into the Singularity
    will cause the collective disharmonious impact on social consensus
    to accelarate in mutation.

- both jungian progression and regression can result from social
  isolation, whereby in addition to other general developmental
  effects also results in typological filtration of the social
  imposition of norms via constriction of experience-types.
  - as the variety and distribution of norms in society appears to the
    isolated person, this typological restriction make provoke a
    disnormalization of the perception of norms and/or normative
    behavior in society.
  - this disregulation of the social apprehension of norms may be
    responsible for tweaking the hyperparameters for learning and
    cognitive flexibility -- in ways both beneficial and/or
    detrimental.  Ultimately as this dysregulated state of the
    apprehension of information and belief about norms
  - as the person gradually drifts away from social consensus of
    norms, this allows them to update the hyperparameters and
    solutions in an ad hoc infinite-dimensional analytic-model of the
    world, wherein they explore the solution space in some ways
    adjacent to social consensus. this not unlike a socially
    distributed boltzmann machine -- both with and without schematic
    overlap between individual boltzmann processes' differing, but
    replicating structures -- where reintegration brings change as
    novel information structures are distributed into society and vie
    to alter group consensus. this could be imagined as a process of
    piagettian genetic epistemology, in which there is some universal
    way of communicating between social entities which are boltzmann
    processes in an ad hoc boltzmann

- therefore, the individual's own disnormalization is exacerbated

=======

- norms from different areas of life can be seen through a unified
  lense.
  - legal norms are much more well-structured. in common law,
    reasoning about legal norms via precedent affects judicial
    decisions.
  - open with a discussion on legal norms (question distinctions
    between social and legal norms), since they are more tightly
    structured and there is wider consensus. from here move to the
    definition,

- In H-ILJ, it is primarily the lack of a definitive supreme authority
  (along with a confluence of other complex factors) that results in
  the “uncertainties of epistemology” in international law
  implementation that require its reliance on legal norms.

> “... thus the power to determine the exact content of that norm most
> often lies not with any international body, but with sovereign
> states themselves (who will often disagree with each other)”

- ... hence, the enforceability, the likelihood of action on norms,
  etc ... relies on the spread of a norm’s distribution. The less
  clear that polarization is exhibited among parties contesting some
  norm, given the Clausewitz definition of polarization applied to
  those parties’ interpretation of it, the less likely there is to be
  action. That is, if disparity among a norm’s interpretation occurs,
  it’s corresponding multi-variate distribution may either spread out
  over a large area of variables or be contained tightly. If there is
  no disparity, the Dirac delta function occurs and the distribution’s
  volume singularizes under one point. If the distribution
  singularizes under two points, given all actors’ interpretations,
  then you have maximal bipolarity spread across two opposing
  camps. The degree of correlation and contention amongst the
  epistemic content of each parties’... (establishes) the magnitude of
  disparity which may result in conflict. However, as these maximal
  special cases of volume distribution break down and norms become
  distributed over larger regions of their variables, the potential
  arises for actors to be clustered over larger regions. Even though
  these clusters may exhibit strong inter-cluster polarization, the
  way each clusters’ actors spread over larger regions results in
  reduced compulsion for resolution and more epistemically
  uncertainty. This applies to social norms as well. However, the
  implications to epistemic uncertainty of norms (and the variables
  whereby they may be parameterized or disaggregated) change as: the
  number of actors scales up, the norms epistemic structure break
  down, and the definition of actor becomes less rigidly structured —
  the last of which is why the definition of sovereignty to Int’l
  Legal Realism is critical.

Clausewitz (chapter one, section 15, on polarity)
- (briefly explain this point, perhaps in footnote)
- this section’s definition of polarity in sociophysical systems
  (perhaps quantified by some data science component) holds when
  Brouwer’s fixpoint theorem holds. When a Brouwer translation is
  necessary, the principle of polarity breaks down. This is
  essentially equivalent to the last sentence of section 15.

TODO: sort imported content from notes

Modesty: discuss any deviation from norm as potential for meaning in
non-verbal communication
- a social norm is a belief about a multivariate distributions’
  characteristics: what are the perceived average or reasonable values
  for those variables. a norm is not necessarily a distribution in
  itself, but at least an informal belief about a distribution. to
  study norms, formalizing them into data-driven definitions helps,
  but also is not necessarily capable of capturing the ephemeral or
  sporadic structures that people may use to reason about them.
- disnormalization pares with a state of perceived auncertainty
  regarding the state of norms, though perhaps unconcious
- normalization as a social process is similar to normalization of
  database schema in that the social process results in the
  coalescence and distribution of (schematic abstractions) ... that is
  social norms frame informational schematic that we use to perceive
  both state in social systems and the meaning in actions/words.
- Metamodernism (as applied to norms) describes the ebb/flow between
- Top down and bottom up understanding on normative social
  structures. From the bottom up, norms on interpersonal relations and
  communication stratify into increasingly sophisticated and
  regularized structures. These latter normative structures preciptate
  from human interaction and conflict at various levels (regional,
  national, contextual, etc) and include legal systems and social
  institutions (and the actions/policies/interfaces thereof)
- The point: denormalization and the state of disnormalization (even
  in norms concerning language, communication and etc), from the
  bottom up, absolutely does extend a denormalizing effect to higher
  strata. Even when norms related to social communication are
  disrupted, this can extend to unpredictable and destabilizing
  effects in regional or nation legal spheres, if this denormalization
  is significant or systemic. But the greatest potential for
  disruption emerges from the lack of awareness and unconscious
  reactions to denormalization — the people who’s social norms are
  being disrupted at an accelerating rate are almost certainly
  unconscious to the process and it’s consequences.
- emphasize the consequences to communication, language, semantics,
  relevance of symbols, and how this denormalizes the epistemic
  structures of schema and abstraction that we use to harmonize
  meaning-making in communication.  When communicating between
  divergent filter-bubbles, especially in politcal discourse,
  anticipating conveyed meaning has become a Tower of Babel. The
  confusion is intentional: filter bubbles allow various groups whose
  bubbles overlap to inculcate vastly different meaning for the same
  semiotic signifiers -- e.g. triggers, words, acronyms. To insulate
  their group from developments in disparate groups, sophisticated
  hacks of langauge are taking place to short-circuit open
  discourse.
  - long-term conditioning to normalize beliefs and reactions.
  - this confounds communication and perhaps even language. The
    semiotic remapping of the "OK" sign by the left is probably The
    Worst Example.

========

- It is a certainly a skill to pepper your rhetoric with logical
  fallacies camouflaged cleverly enough as to pass by your average
  supporter or detractor. These allow you to gain ground or cover your
  bases when responding to unforeseen development surrounding some
  issue or policy. Still, when groups (especially political groups)
  advance with overtaxed rhetoric, this makes it much easier to apply
  their own arguments and premises against them. They will be
  unwilling to walk into this trap if they see it coming, but the
  average supporter will not, if they drink the kool-aid.

![Evolution of Norms](/img/posts/2018-12-10-the-analytic-i-ching/norm-evolution-1.jpg)

In the context of social norms as distributions, methods similar to KL
and OT may extrapolate forward in time the likely developments for a
given norm's distribution. Thus, as belief coalesces, this socially
distributed belief feeds back into the norm. This dependency on belief
must begin with a minimal quantity of socially distributed information
relevant to the norm being formed collectively by social groups --
albeit this does not account for the schematic aspects of norms, since
they are informal and ad hoc.

There are differential aspects to the evolution of the norm as this
quantity of socially distributed information accumulates mass and
momentum. The norm begins with some minimal "mass" of information and
gradually changes shape as it accumulates more mass or change in
momentum. During this process the initial shape of the normative
distribution, the informational salience and allocation of attention
all feedback into the process of evolution, similar to the initial
values of a differential equation. How the norm is oriented in its
nascent stages strongly impacts trajectory, tone and pace of the
normative development. Once the norm achieves widespread social
consensus, far more energy, treatment for saliency and redirection of
attention is required to result in significant changes to the
distribution.

![photo more clearly describing norm evolution (from index card?)]()

- perception of norms before social consensus on norms

EDIT: Prior to consensus on norms relating to a specific event or
phenomena, the structure of norms that may develop is more open
ended. In public relations, it's critical to set the tone early
because the ideas that gain momentum early become difficult to change
as social consensus begins to form. It is inevitable for some opinions
or perspectives to lose their momentum. When politicians gain ground
with fallacious arguments or with tactics requiring too many
dependencies to hold, perhaps one makes gains, but the risks for loss
may be greater. When it becomes necessary to exert energy in
controlling the evolution of social consensus, opinions or the release
of information, then simply exerting information to control these
dependencies can give you away. These are insights that may be gained
by applying the Laplacian to social information systems: where is
energy being invested to direct developments in public opinion and
why? It's critical to set the tone early, but to do so in accordance
with knowledge of future developments and with your personal values.

When you have a robust system of values that informs your ethical
behavior, your strategic calculus and your identification of
opportunity, then you act moving forwards in ways that should prevent
such regressive unraveling of gains on specific issues. If some set of
universally justified values exists upon which to base a system of
ethics (i.e. if God exists or if some other perfect values system
exists), then to be in accordance with that is to be assured that your
actions will always have been for the best. Such assumptions hinge on
whether there exists some perfect system of values, whether you are
perfectly in tune with it and whether your embodiment of those values
through your actions was optimal. Regardless -- a well-developed sense
of values informing your sense of morality and character offers
immeasurable advantages.

Social consensus on sufficient ethical behavior is not guaranteed to
be normal in a society, which must propagate norms surrounding ethical
behavior. [This article on
Aeon]((https://aeon.co/ideas/legal-standards-invoke-the-reasonable-person-who-is-it))
dives into the legalistic motivations behind determining the
reasonable person's response in specific situations. When this becomes
relevant to logic in legal argumentation -- i.e. when court decisions
must take into account some decisive conclusion as to a "reasonable
person's" action and motivation -- then such arguments become
[deontic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deontic_logic) in
nature. Thus, the logic of such arguments requires assessing norms of
perception, thought, action and values in society. In criminal and
civil cases, this can help the courts determine whether such actions
were subversive: did some person determine their actions assuming they
could explain away their intents later on to avoid consequences?

### (Norms, Communication and the Expectation of Perceived Meaning)

# Wherever A Norm Exhibits Social Consensus...

- The utility of an implicit language is established by the consensus
  of norms and the perceived consensus of norms.
  - Political parties can conduct implicit communication amongst
    themselves after conditioning norms related to their platforms,
    logistics, policies and messaging. Altering any of the above, so
    long as members within or outside of the party may realistically
    acknowledge it can be used by party officials for
    signalling. Conditioning other parties to develop specific
    apprehension of norms can allow party officials to predict and
    reason about the other sides inferred meaning of action. The same
    implies to the networks of actors, sovereign, corporate or
    otherwise in the realm of international relations. Via messaging,
    communications and cultural programmes, these actors also induce
    other actors to perceive extranormal meanings.
  - In a Forbidden City palance of the Ming dynasty, it would be
    reasonable for household staff to assume any vase or object to be
    layered with additional meanings -- via extension of Wu Xing
    philosophy. The basis for signaling via these subtle explicit
    meanings would be leavened within staff by gradual
    inculcation. Those initiated into the moreso alchemical
    implications of manipulating some embued object would then be
    aware of how additional consequences may result via non-verbal
    signaling implied by the specific embued meanings. These are
    elements of semioteleological programs and protocols. It is
    expensive and risky to assume that all communication must be
    written or spoken! So, by embuing

### [Social Consensus of Abstractions is What Distinguishes Man From Animal]()

Language itself is the social consensus on abstraction.
Neuroanalytically, each abstraction is a representation of some
stimulus pattern within the mind, whether the stimulus arises
completely internally or externally. Many species operate with
neurological abstractions, though few develop complicated behavior
patterns with layered or interwoven abstractions. The [tool-using
carpenter finch](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Woodpecker_finch) is an
example of an animal with sequences of problem-solving behavior
predicated on seeking objects within its environment that satisfy some
abstracted need related to shape and object properties. This finch
does not intentionally distribute information related to this behavior
to other animals.

There are other animals which socially distribute consensus of
abstraction -- meerkats are a great example with abstracted relations
within and outside of their species -- but there are no animals which
have developed the abstraction of abstractions: langauge. Language
allows man to distribute meaning with statements yielding complicated,
nuanced semantic implications upon evaluation. There are other animals
which possess some of the required neurological and genetic elements
required to partially satisfy the dependencies for language. The most
complicated seems to be a multi-generational persistence of anatomical
features required to render normative the emission of phonemes -- this
seems far more complex than satisfying the neurological
requirements. This means to epi/genetically restrict anatomical
variation of the face, tongue, diaphram, larnyx and other components
so that they are locked in across multiple generations. The complex
anatomical variation of dogs prevents such transgenerational
normificaiton of anatomic features that guarantee the capability of
phonemes. It must be
[almost-certain](https://www.google.com/search?client=safari&rls=en&q=almost+certain&ie=UTF-8&oe=UTF-8)
for all members of a species to emit phonemes, given their course
anatomical development. This requires limiting phenotypic variance
resulting in change of shape to face, toungue, nasal cavity,
esophogus, diaphram -- the capability of any member of a species to
produce a given phoneme must asymptotically converge to one.

![Persistence of Memory]()

Given this and the neurological requirements, then developing language
seems to be a matter of the time required to generate phonological
inter-species communication. If these are given, the stream enough
data through a socially interconnected network of analytical machines
and "Tada!" the species begins to harmonize their phonological
abstractions that signal some abstracted type of experienced stimuli,
none of which *requires* grammar which itself doubtlessly ups the
neurological requirements. Morphemes, at this point, are easy to
develop if their implied meaning is assumed by normative relationship
to environmental phenomenology -- i.e. most morphemes begin as
onomatopoeia that a species is capable of emulating.  From this point
onwards, for all increasing sophistication of linguistic abstractions
and capabilities, progress results from variety of experience,
standardization of experience, bandwidth in interspeicies
communication, neurological capabilities such as memory, variety or
utility of social behaviors exhibited by the species and the number of
simultaneously living generations -- i.e. the sociophysical
dependencies for persistence of memory. The last two in that list are
perhaps more critical than all the others?

How are meaning and processes are to be retained if the informational
units corresponding to it are not replicated and internalized?

- correlate this back towards the interpretation of morphemes and
  phonemes exemplifying norms as distributions.
  - but the perceived social consensus of some morpheme is critical to
    making assumptions about whether meaning was perceived.
  - so there is some threshold for normalization of perceived meaning
    that is required for the perception of normalization of perceived
    meaning to result
  - otherwise, members of a species could assume it would be more
    "normal" to pretend they didn't understand a word you were saying
    -- *AND HOW FRUSTRATING WOULD THAT BE?* Anyone who has experienced
    an prepubescent adolescent pretend to not understand the meaning
    implied by a word in a command can understand how frustrating that
    is. When adolescents may believe that it is reasonable to assume
    that your implied meaning wouldn't normally understood by other
    people, then they *believe* they can do whatever they want and
    then *feigning non-compliance from a misperception of meaning is a
    reasonable defense*. Just don't bet the farm on it.

- wherever there is a norm, there is the potential for signaling via
  deviation from the norm. this is one factor that drives social
  consensus for rules of etiquette and other cultural protocols: if
  the norm has wide social consensus and establishes via
  semioteleological programming protocols of both interaction and
  behavior, then its pervasiveness allows for implicit signaling by
  deviation. if do not cohere to these norms with near certainty, the
  those in the local social neighborhood cannot read your signaling
  via deviation from those perceived norms. Because society or your
  local social group coheres to the norm with near certainty, then as
  a member of that group you do not signal as much information by
  blending in to the protocols of ettiquette as you do by defying
  those norms.
  - Even though everyone may be engaged in sophisticated behaviors and
    interactions

  - if you do not know the rules, it shows -- individuals without
    cognizance of the norms that lay the groundwork of ettiquete
    behave such that their behavior places them randomly within the
    multivariate distributions for those norms. That is, when
    informally comparing naive individuals to those who are
    "well-adjusted" to the norms relevant to those social
    programmes...

  - When individuals demonstrate cognizance of patterns of norms used
    for interaction protocols, this forms a kind of fingerprint not
    unlike that of a digital signature. For example, if someone has
    never used heroin before, then they should be unaware of norms
    related to heroin usage. It's not that hard to understand, I have
    simply modeled systematized this behavior of acquiescing cultural
    exposure via signals of cognizance to norms -- a behavior of which
    every 16 year-old is aware![^socially-retarded] These fingerprints
    for semiotelelogical programs, which leverage normative signaling,
    are more sophisticated than digital signitures in the kinds of
    queries they enable about cognizance to socioinformational
    structures.

    - Imagine training an AI algorithm in pattern recognition of these
      fingerprints of normative signaling programs.
      - This program might make inferences related to one or more of
        the following from sociophysical input regarding an individual
        or a social group:
        - &#9312; Are they aware of specific norms?
        - &#9313; Are they intentially signaling via adherence to or
          deviation from a norm?
        - &#9314;
      - How would the features be structured for the machine learning
        model?
        - They would be infinite dimensional, thus countability, the
          structure of data, comparison between feature mappings are
          all issues.
        - Because feature sets and feature mappings are difficult to
          compare for even the mathematically properties of identity
          and equality, this introduces problems of tractibility and
          confidence in results -- but paradoxically also makes
          fingerprints much

          -- individually amoung the same AI entity, but)
    - the features forming the basis of an analytical model of pattern
      recognition to detect belief, information, and cognizance of
      norms that are related to some normative signaling program.

    - their behavior is distributed along these variables and informal
      programsis not well-structured
    - however, since



  (If people in society do not adhere to (any) norms), propogate the
  traditions that establish them or ... then no one can use those
  norms (nor the deviation from them) for signaling. what results is a
  gradual breakdown in the quality and consistency of both non-verbal
  and non-literal communication -- it is out-of-band signaling,
  usually broadcast on an implicit channel. Any culture which receives
  a sudden flux of cultural or economic change -- perhaps via
  imperialism or the growth of religion -- experiences a breakdown of
  such potential for communication.

  - The nature of norms as they relate to communication generally is
    not well understood by most people within a society, thus they
    can't see the socioinformational fabric shifting beneath their
    feet as it is happening. They don't understand how their
    traditions and the social consensus thereof contribute to
    effective communication, especially when it's necessary to
    communicate such that only those *inside* the culture may
    understand the implicit meanings. When the norms break down, a
    long term destabalizing effect is produced whereby signaling
    amoung members of a culture is impacted. The effect is slow. It's
    not usually perceived as it is happening. It's easy for outsiders
    to trivialize aspects of a culture that they don't understand. By
    convincing the youth to similar question traditions that seem
    backwards, the outsiders un/intentionally may damage the
    perpetuation of tradition necessary for harmony.

  - Individuals and societies are not necessarily aware of the
    teleological functions of tradition and norm. It is certainly
    useful for elders in a culture to be aware of the teleological
    aspects of norms and traditions, whether they were designed with
    purpose or where evolved ad hoc. Regardless, people tend to
    propagate the norms and traditons for which they see purpose and
    functionality. By enacting the rules of etiquette or following
    tradtion, individuals are influencing the social election of memes
    to transmit and propagate. These evolve over time, but when there
    is significant disruption that systemically affects the traditions
    of a culture, there may be unreconcilable damage to a society.

  - The implicit non-verbal communication found in traditions and in
    deviation from norms derives power from its emotional relavance in
    the psyches of those who use it to communicate. There is no
    dictionary that defines the meaning conveyed by signaling via
    tradition or norm. This lack of denotative meaning requires a
    slower, more expensive process of inculcation to socially
    distribute the connontation of communicative acts. Without this
    inculcation, individuals in the society cannot perceive these
    actions to signal meaning that is relevant or consistent. The
    connotative meanings of these actions are layered and
    duplicitous. These actions enable complex methods of signaling
    which are powerful and may only be perceived by those who
    understand them. Establishing such connotations requires
    establishing or perpetuating social memory that corresponds to
    some implicit meaning for an action, often relating to the
    teleological significane of the tradition or norm.

  - Dilute the social memory and suddenly it becomes normative to
    assume that no one knows what that means anymore. Before the age
    of the internet, this would be like making a joke with a Bonanza
    reference to a teenager in the 90's -- they have no clue what
    you're talking about. Today, this is like making references to old
    memes or memes without enough social distribution for reasonable
    expectation of consistent meaning to be conveyed. Personally, I
    detest meme templates in my newsfeed ... but please, bear with me.


Remember the first set of memes that came out? Scumbag Steve? The
Obsessed Girlfriend? There was a limited set of symbols established by
the memes, which resonated strongly enough with people to power those
meme's social election over others. Yet, once the idea of memed-images
became normalized and the arcane secrets of automated meme-generation
became commonplace, this unleashed a deluge of idiosyncratic memes. If
an internet meme does not have wide distribution, then one cannot
anticipate consistent apprehension of meaning in those who see it --
it has not become normalized.

####

![picture of Zipf's Distribution]()

Social media will never again return to a state where there the
share-frequency of memes is restricted to to such a limited set of
memes templates. To understand this, apply the idea of [Zipf's
Distribution]() to meme templates: from now on, the sum of all of meme
distribution on social media will spread out into over a greater
number of meme templates. There is some threshold of social consensus
required for most individuals to form the expectation that meaning
will be perceived as it is intended without denotation or
clarification. When the frequency of meme-shares becomes diluted into
so many meme templates, it is rare for any meme to naturally gain
enough momentum to surpass that threshold.

#### Hence, Pew Die Pie Meme Review

As a sociocultural phenomenon that emerged primarily from the UI/UX
design considerations of Twitter and Facebook, reasoning about how and
why people elect internet memes as a vehicle for communication is
fascinating. Why did facebook introduce the feature that attaches a
background image to be attached to a simple textual status update
message? Because memes are a hack: the idea is that your potential
viewers are scrolling quickly. If your text is large and simple with
an easily recognized image, this is far more likely to have its
meaning conveyed within the UI/UX confines of mobile social
media. Thus the form factors of social media are exhibiting a grossly
destabalizing effect on the quality of communication -- see the
footnote for specific criticism.[^neuro-social-media]

I'm critical of memes primarily because too many complex ideas are
condensed into a picture with 50 words or less. This results in
impaired communication: too much communication on the internet has
simply become noise. I don't care how many likes some image has --
unless I get a good laugh ... but isn't that just the intellectual
equivalent of junk food? Are people seriously stupefied on how Russia
hacked the American election? Can you actually hack a communications
system that's inherently broken? Regardless of whether Russia
interfered or the specifics of the details thereof ... do Americans
actually expect for people to have reasonable opinions on critical
issues? Most terrifying: blame it on Russia or don't, is there any way
to fix the true underlying problems?

Doesn't democracy depend on an informed public? What are the
consequences on disregulation of communication?



disregulation of meaning.

- semiotics, semantics and reasonable expectations of meaning.

- when can one reasonably expect meaning to be conveyed? how do people
  communicate about norms?
  - how can people expect to communicate with body language? how does

- TODO: decide on terminology
  - emphasize disnormalization's disruption to language, non-verbal
    communication and parsing meaning from action/symbols
  - touch on how the distributed nature of agency in AI entities will
    allow them outpace man's ability to keep up with disnormalization.
    - so while we will struggle with social consensus of meaning and
      norms, (artificial entities will have much less difficulty doing
      so.)

- define denormalization, as it applies herein, as a process between
  normalized and disnormalized. define disnormalization as it applies
  variously in the contexts of individual psychology, sociocultural
  settings, etc as a state of dissociation from norms.
  - because of the singularity's accelerating sociocultural
    destabalization, absent some artificial forces of normalization,
    society will continue to become destructured.

### But What If Norms With Widely Distributed Social Consensus Are Rare?

Disnormalization describes a sociocultural phenomena where it becomes
more normal for ideas to resist normification. As humanity approaches
the singularity, technology will begin to evolve faster than we can
culturally adjust to it. Determining what is considered normal is
necessary in the deontic logic of legal argumentation involving the
[reasonable person](). For socioinformational systems where
disnormatization is prevalent: norms either manifest slowly, resist
social consensus or are not formed in time to be relevant.
Disnormatization is not about the formation, development or
obselescence of individual norms. Instead, it concerns dynamics of
norms within some realm, including legal, social or linguistic
spheres. Is the system in such a state where it is reasonable to
expect that norms will coalesce naturally as a product of social
interaction? Particularly, does some system, realm or social network
generally exhibit social consensus on norms?

When the phenomenon of disnormalization becomes prevelant in some
sphere, this implies that either &#9312; the social experiences which
tend to cause individuals to perceive norms no longer facilitate the
conception of norms or &#9313; the distribution of information about
norms is impaired. Both may occur when speciation of information
around which individual norms would be formed becomes too complex:
that is, the nature of each individual's experiences are so distinct
that there aren't enough common traits or patterns of experience upon
which to reason about other individual's experiences. The difficulty
of validating one's own perception of norms from within the skew of a
filter bubble is one technological mechanism that potential
contributes to disnormalization.

- TODO: how will disnormalization affect international relations?
  - impacts to sociocultural & domestic political norms will tend to
    cause many of the issues hinted at in this article from [Harvard
    ILJ](http://www.harvardilj.org/wp-content/uploads/HLI204_crop.pdf)
    - e.g. breakdown of rationality and well-definedness of states due
      to turbulent cultural/political situations ... it's
      sociocultural disnormalization that leads to a contentious
      situation where [ideological] conflict over norms is
      necessary/possible.
- TODO: move content about normification here.

- what happens when norms evolve faster than people can keep up?
  - explain the sociocultural phenomena of disnormatization as a
    metaphor to breaking the speed of sound.
    - as we approach the singularity, technology and culture evolve
      faster than norms can be established and diffused. Since the
      human brain is an analytical machine, people require
      conditioning via experience (to develop the social instantiation
      of types of beliefs upon which norms are constructed). That is,
      an individual's conception of a norm requires some type,
      metatype or abstraction of experience whereby beliefs about
      aggregate beliefs are grouped.
      - To develop beliefs about norms, individuals must reason about
        how others categorize, structure and organize their
        experiences, information or beliefs.
      - Similarly to how grouping a SQL table by the `id` column
        returns a result where all the counts are 1, attempting to...

      - assertions about norms, proactively establishing norms and
        diffusing information to reinforce social perception of norms
        each alleviate problems related to tractibility in
        sociophysical systems.
        - since it's impossible to reason about socially distributed
          information in totality, people instead reason with
          approximated representations of aggregate belief.

    - similar to how breaking the sound barrier introduces completely
      novel dynamics for aerospace engineers to design around.
      - in any dynamical system, the emergence of specific dynamics
        can impact the system such that fundamentally novel measures
        are required to address these. Simply expecting a linear
        increase of *more of the same* to address engineering
        challenges at transonic speeds is not enough.
      - e.g. the sudden emergence of [vapor
        cone](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vapor_cone) at transonic
        speeds is introduced by extreme fluctuations in pressure and
        temperature that affect the rate of water condensation. This
        changes the composition, distribution and phases of matter in
        the air, which impacts the surface of the jet in fundamentally
        novel ways.

  - Such insights from dynamical systems may be carried back over to
    the phenomena of disnormalization, (which the world is only
    beginning to see). The sonic boom and transonic phenomena are
    unlike most dynamical phenomena in that there is a sudden boundary
    beyond which the phenomena is seen -- the range of transonic
    speeds.
  - How does industry in Silicon Valley diffuse information into
    society? How does one explain the phenomenological implications of
    data science, machine learning and networked computer systems to a
    five-year old or to your grandmother?
    - When these technologies evolve faster, how does the rate of
      sociocultural adaptation match the technology's rollout? Can
      people adapt quickly enough? There seems to be a point at which
      the rate of change of technology, analogous to the speed of the
      jet, far exceeds some maximal rate of sociocultural adaption,
      analogous to the propagation of vibrations in air molecules
      around the jet. What results is the emergence of convoluted
      dynamics in sociocultural evolution which are similar to
      transonic dynamics that emerge at the speed of sound.
    - any approach to social engineering to accommodate for these
      novel dynamics must account for them, while ensuring the
      powerful does not seek to abuse disnormalization by selectively
      conducting social engineering -- which has been happening with
      technology for decades.
