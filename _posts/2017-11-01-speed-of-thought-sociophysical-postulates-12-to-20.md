To anticipate flow of energies in sociophysical circuits, especially
with n-phase oscillation and multi-energy transductions, one must
develop recognizing recomposed signatures of deconstructed dynamics in
chaotic sociophysical systems. This idea for recognizing "signatures"
of behavior in programmatic chaotic systems like genetics or social
physics, is briefly described in
[Awareness Precipitates from Order Out Of Chaos](/posts/2017-09-14-awareness-precipitates-from-order-out-of-chaos.html). These
"signatures" are key to pattern recognition of toxic social or
financial behavior, when any specific pattern itself would be
uselessly singular if effable. Effective actors will always seek to
elude or deceive, regardless of their intent. Also, towards operating
in an environment like this, the mimicry or tactical recomposition of
these deconstructed energetic dynamics is necessary for coordinated
strategy.

  hyper/spectral analysis which can be further convoluted with
  gradient/laplacian
  - (assuming the heatmap values map to edge activation values {?})
  - what kind of tensor products construct something like this and
    what maps tie these algebraic convolutions together?

- laplacian of these flows and their aggregates, geographically &
  logically, indicate intent {cut?}

![Heatmap of Combinitorialized Signal Sources](/img/posts/2017-10-21-speed-of-thought-twenty-postulates-of-social-physics/viz-heatmap.png)



- this {wtf is this?} helps indicate intent, even when it was hidden
  - consistency is hard to fake, any duplicity exacerbates this and
    displays itself as merely partial consistency, instead of wider
    coherence of information
  - this ultimately serves to highlight cognizance of intent
- however, when there are competing sets/structures of information
  (which cannot all be true), with large skews in distribution of
  these datums and iota, some datums can be crowded out.

#### Parallel, Anti-Parallel and Orthoganal Coupling In Motion Towards The Attainment of Equilibrium Unveils Nearly All Deception

- someone with a goal in mind will tend to move TOWARDS or AWAY from
  it when signalling. if they don't feel the need to deceive you, they
  won't fake you out by amplifying signal that conveys moving AWAY
  from some intended area of equilibrium
- someone who lacks an agenda or with few goals will exhibit something
  like brownian motion extended to these high-dimensional spaces
  - there is little intentional motion or it's clear to see they are
    concerned about their own life. their behavior isn't highly or
    loosely coupled to you
  - duplicitously justified behavior, random behavior and proactive
    behavior is critical to winning these high-dimensional,
    (poorly-defined) sociophysical games
    - that is, this adversary will deconstruct their strategies into
      duplicities tactics. they will smash their intent and strategy
      into fragments and shards, then force their will into agents
      they control,
      - who are ideally acting zealously or righteously towards the
        attainment of these fragments
      - these agents are encouraged to compete vigorously
      - these agents often do not or can't see through the duplicity
      - {i talk about duplicity in the next situation}
    - in order to win, you play both sides against one another {??}
      vigorously, deconstructing your plan into pieces, avoiding the
      need to even deflect causal inference by making everything a lie
      - when someone starts getting close to the truth, the stark
        contrast between that truth and the sea of disinformation
        gives you the smoke that indicates fire

#### Equilibrium and Intended Equilibrium


#### Stasis of Equilibria

- what balance of equilibria do people seek?
- once they believe feel they have achieved some particular set of
  equilibria, how do they reorient their energy?
  - some feel satisfied and stop chasing any objective, only beginning
    again when they feel they've lost the equilibria they attained.
  - some move on to the next objectives
  - some never feel satisfied with attaining anything and mercilessly
    strive on.

#### Simple Distinguishing Factor Underlying Human Behavior

- the behavior you need to watch for is when an adversary compels some
  sociophysical system to attain particular equilibria, while they
  hide these same objectives.
  - they will prefer to not attract attention to causing the system to
    evolve towards these equilibria
  - if they are (skilled), then to confuse you, they signal with
    antiparallel motion away from the points of equilibria
    - if they do this, they will also interject random motion into the
      system pushing sociophysical metrics in many confusing or
      seemingly intentional directions
  - if they are part of a network, then your adversaries will seek to
    deconstruct their agenda or desired equilibria into many pieces.
    - they will delegate goals and objectives to entities in their
      networks with agency.
      - if this is happening, fucking run ... but it may not help.

  - when delegating across a network, agents can actually appear to
    work against one another towards the attainment of equilibria of
    specific sociophysical metrics. this is good cop & bad cop, but in
    a more advanced setting (not an interrogation at the downtown
    station)
    - one tries to isolate you, the other tries to draw you in
      specific directions. then they can see how you respond to
      make inferences about your behavior
    - this also forces your investment of energy to dissipate

- someone with an agenda is generally gravitating towards the
  attainment of a set of objectives/equilrium

    objectives, which confer advantage, control or mitigate some risk
    - what is an appropriate delination of terms? how do they relate
      to the concepts below: folding funnel, energy, entropy/entropy,
      potential conformation paths, local minima

- When proteins fold, ...
  - {maybe a picture really is worth 1000 words here, lol}
    - i want to mostly focus on:
      - (1) the singular final conformation, which is usually singular
        by necessity
      - (2) how enthalpy overpowers entropy here to arrive at a final
        stable conformation, even though this is not always so for all
        possible protein structures.
        - ... actually they would mostly have many local energy
          minima, but it's the relationship b/w form & function

  - what is the term for the energy value in the folding funnel?
  - the proteins structure is guided (randomly) along the curved
    surface of the folding funnel


  - in spite of entropy, enthalpy guides the folding towards local
    minima. in order for the protein to have consistent form and
    function, this typically must

  - the protein contains (evoluationarily-conserved structures) giving
    it an overall form ...

    it is also describing a general progression towards embodying the
    values of Buddhist thought.

- rearrange the following
- (understanding how this relates to game theory and the equilibrium
  dynamics above is fascinating)
  - regardless of how proficiently manipulative someone might be, when
    you free yourself of negative intention, then decoupling yourself
    from any predisposition of intentionality, etc/etc... gradually
    becoming formless, you cannot be predicted/anticipated/etc.
    - why is this? is it because all manipulative/evil people must be
      driven by attachments to their desires/etc?
      - if so, are those who progress through and embody these states
        of mind necessarily pure? does this progression move towards
        an ideal that is the opposite of the being Mara epitomizes?
        - or is it instead a state purely devoid of the elements
          required for suffering/evil?

#### "Be Water, My Friend"

- someone who (understands, absorbs, reacts to) the presence of the
  sets of objectified equilibria that determine, is (wise...)
  - someone who is free from attachment to and desire for (obtaining,
    maintaining, altering) any particular set of equilibria is not
    only fluid, but incomprehensible to Mara (the Evil One)
    - they become quite literally invisible to even the most
      (manipulative/deceitful) groups of people, who can't conceive of
      someone who could not be controlled by desire or attachment
    - "trackless, he has destroyed Mara's vision..."
      - 

  - wisely, they act today with the possibilities of tomorrow in mind:
    they conserve their potential energies to maximize any potential
    transformation they may need in the future
    - this is usually (...always?) best done by minimizing your
      informational footprint.

What is probabilistic programming? What are programs in chaos?
[This article](http://te.xel.io/posts/2017-09-14-awareness-precipitates-from-order-out-of-chaos.html)
argues that biophysical, sociophysical and metaphysical systems are
like programming frameworks where manipulation of feedback loops
enables a degree of antifragility, propagates facsimilarity and
promotes competition for accumulated reservoirs of energy.

There are means of modeling and studying both chaotic systems and the
design of programmatic systems within them. This applies to fields
such as the engineering of genetics and human logistic systems. The
tools for modeling these systems include
[Markovian state machines](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Markov_chain)
within a kind of
[probability space](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Probability_space)
that's distributed over some physical space. A critical concept in
biophysical programs is spatially distributed state: the variables of
these programs are the physically manifested byproducts of events. The
program "executes" by influencing the quantity, state, and
spatiotemporal location of these variables, which in turn influence
the frequencies of subsequent events in space.

#### Within Each of Us, Multitudes of Reflection And Refraction Descend and Ascend Infinitely

![Yin and Yang Across Space](/img/posts/2017-10-21-speed-of-thought-twenty-postulates-of-social-physics/yin-yang-across-space.jpg)

For sociophysical systems, these ideas of programming with
probabilistic and chaotic systems must include networks of entities
with agency whose inschematic Markovian state machines are tightly
coupled to facets of their environment, methods of communication and
means of interaction. For social physics, dynamics and mechanics of
multifarious strata homogeneously feed back into the system as a whole
where entities in each strata influence the macroscopic and
microscopic. [SOF entities](te.xel.io/posts/2017-10-12-treatise-on-entity-and-agency.html)
are containers of state, will and agency on one scale, but
dualistically exist within a sociophysical system where macroscopic
containers of the same omnidirectionally influence one another.

Here, the particles exhibit perfect holonic perfraction, though the
total experiential understanding of this truth is incomputable for any
entity that ever be manifested on the physical plane. No false god, no
hyperintelligent entity, no network of superintelligent entities no
matter how human or artificial could ever conceive these
combinatorially perfracted structures. It is like a fractal of Yin and
Yang that pervades every sentient entity capable of agency. The only
entity that can conceive this exists as the metaphysical totality,
God, which does extend itself into our universe in unimaginable ways.

#### Yin and Yang is the 2-Form of a Fractal in Two Dimensions

![Infinities of Yin and Yang](/img/posts/2017-10-21-speed-of-thought-twenty-postulates-of-social-physics/yin-yang-fractal.jpg)

People throughout history have always been more capable of
understanding truths such as these, as well as the world around us, in
ways the modern person cannot conceive.

To understand this more fully, read the sections after
[無 de nada](/posts/2016-05-16-the-paradox-of-creativity.html#zen-de-nada)
in this discourse on the
[Paradox of Creativity](/posts/2016-05-16-the-paradox-of-creativity.html). There
are profound implications for how any cultural engineering should
envision teleology, so mankind can benefit from the replacement of
obselesced cultural practices for empowerment via semiotic
amplification that traces out self-empowering teleology. Before,
during and after the Singularity, almost all outdated cultural
practices which before teleologically inculcated knowledge and wisdom
will instead totally lose their relevance. They will be so
infrequently performed, that their ability to reinforce understandings
about life and society via teleological inference will instead simply
disintegrate.

In social physics, all SOF biophysical entities exist in the same
shared physical space. Their minds are like individual boltzmann
machines, but with a functional twist. Instead of being machine
learning constructs to recognize patterns in images, each brain is a
biophysical construct for consuming, recognizing and emulating
behaviors. Throughout life, we consume experiential and sensory
information. We reflect on those memories to produce, alter and store
aggregate memories. With increased quantity and expanded variety, our
brains layer down strata of conditioned mental residue. From our
current mental and neurological state, we correlate conditioned
phenomena -- such as behaviors, images and symbols -- to perceiving,
introspecting, replicating and altering the state of sociophysical
macrocosms, both spatiotemporally local and distant.

#### [Observation of LCD Phase Defects](https://phys.org/news/2017-06-phase-transition-liquid-crystal-defects.html) Are Centered As A System Cools Over Time

![LCD Phase Changes](/img/posts/2017-10-21-speed-of-thought-twenty-postulates-of-social-physics/lcd-phase-change-defects.png)

We have an innate desire to simulate and emulate, which drives our
learning process. Because this process is *similar* to a Boltzmann
machine, once an individual develops in a particular psychosocial
direction, they can become less likely to change. This may be a
property of Boltzmann machines -- categorically and typologically, as
simultaneously running image-recognition Boltzmann machines diverge,
each one become less capable of deviating from it's current category
and singleton metatype-composition. What does the picture above
symbolize for epistemological defects in shared knowledge systems
developed by cooperative entities? These entities are essentially
[Boltzmann machines](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boltzmann_machine)
with myriad arbitrary notions of temperature and sociophysical energy.

- expand on this
  - transition to discussing how we attempt to model each other's
    knowledge, behavior and direction of focus.
  - by attempting to control the current, short-term or long-term
    direction of an entity's focus, their variety of input and
    experience can be both constrained and dialated
    - if you want to ruin someone's life and psychology, tightly
      constrain their variety of experience over the long-term

- by learning how people direct their focus,
  - their reactions can be anticipated. learning this takes time and
    investment of energy in a variety of experiences with the person.
    - this has both positive and negative uses. this is how you build
      a connection or relationship with a new friend.
      - if someone's interactions and social network are tightly
        constrained, they can't maintain a variety of interactions
        with people
      - when this is done to the extreme, it results in the utter and
        total deterioration of their support network.

conceived as incomprehensibly complex analogies of the same
macromolecules used in biophysical programs. That is, information can
be conceptualized in holonic particle form, entities exchange datums
and iotas of holonic information particles and these entities *are*
information. To understand what an information particle might look
like, envision a high-dimensional analogue of the yin and yang fractal
above. Finally, imagine molecules composed of such matter: this is
what your mind is made of.

- (the sociophysical transmission also gives rise to) literal physical
  waves. further still, the transmission of physical pheneomena also
  drive ripples of information through sociophysical networks.

![The Wave In A Stadium](/img/posts/the-wave.gif)

- if there is a spectral (understanding) of information-graphs, as
  ellusive as a visual conception might be, then surely a momentary
  spectrum can be lifted to a wave representation.
  - (reword this)

- it isn't yet clear how, but the particle/wave duality also fits the
  holonic model of information
  - information in social physics should be modelable as waves,
    communicated among players in social games, idealized as
    particles)
  - social phenomena can be modeled with social physics, but almost
    everything is incomputable.
  - however, similar to how there are many kinds of interactions
    between particles and waves, interactions in social physics can be
    understood with infinite dimensional waves
    - however, the structure of information infinite and unknowable

- density/mass of information as particles
  - baggage you carry with you
  - first episode of Kino
  - limiting flexibility
  - ... explain/outline more here
  - does this relates to buddhism's usage of vehicular imagery?

- applying the idea of superposition of particle states to topologies
  of sociophysical networks.
  - in these networks, information can be represented by particles
    that behave in ways analogous to quantum particles.
  - for (each of us) to (intuitively function in social environments),
    we have to create our own subconscious intuition of sociophysical
    energy types and circuit topologies.
    - to (model/solve/anticipate the system), an algorithm without
      limits on computation must conceive of these networks as having
      infinitely many energy types, each with their own non-linear
      transduction mechanics, being pushed through social circuits,
      via physical and logical interactions
      - ....
      - superposition provides a mechanic that anticipates infinite
        possibilities that collapse into a convergent result in
        reality
        - (still just a metaphor)

- this seems very similar to ideas from quantum computing circuit
  diagrams.

- of course, this analogy of information as particle/wave begs the
  question: what is sociophysical equivalent to critical mass & `E =
  m*c^2`

- [gibb's entropy?](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Entropy_(statistical_thermodynamics)#Gibbs_entropy_formula)

- for the common person to understand, they need to understand what a
  phase change in physics actually is and, most importantly, what a
  phase change is defined as outside of physical systems.
  - if you think of solid, liquid, gas, plasma, BEC ... what makes
    each one what it is?
    - they are composed of the same particles, mostly.
    - why is it that they "seem" so different, qualitatively?
    - how do you define what conditions lead some substance to begin
      to transform itself into a different phase?

- how do you model the interactions between a mixture of a single
  substance where different parts of the space you're observing are in
  different phases?
  - this is the most important part of understanding what a phase
    change is and carrying it over to non-physical systems: how does a
    physicist mathematically model different phases of a
    single-substance system and *why*?
  - this is what distinguishes systems with math that can model phases
    and those that can't.
    - phase changes introduce and enable dramatically different modes
      of interaction between the substance and both it's consitutuent
      parts and it's environment.
    - for example, solids propagate energy as more clearly defined
      waves moving across a more limited set of crystal configurations
      - liquids and gases also propagate waves of energy across the
        system, but there are more physical degrees of freedom for how
        a particle can kinetically react.
      - but, this qualitative change in how a particle reacts to its
        envrionment emerges not from signal particle or the state of
        its local environment, but from more macroscopic relationships
        that emerge from a *group* of particles.
        - that is, it's *difficult* to say whether a single atom of
          carbon is a particular phase at any temperature.
          - the carbon atom just acts like a carbon atom and nothing
            else.
        - as a aside: this is also why various configurations of
          matter at the nano scale can have such dramatically varied
          behaviors that do not appear on more macro scales and do not
          appear for singular atoms and molecules
        - some of these properties are chemical and electrical and,
          thus, are not traditionally considered "phases" by chemists
          or physicists.
          - physical phases are defined as being completely separate
            from the chemical properties of the atom or substance.
        - but the "phase" of a region of a substance determines how
          that section of matter interacts with matter of the same
          substance in other adjacent slices of space.
          - that is, even though it's very literally the same
            substance, the "rules" for how it physically interacts
            change.

- and so, there are phase changes in many kinds of systems. they are
  not just confined to physical systems. some chemical properties of
  matter can be dependent on the substance's phase.
  - some chemical properties that only emerge on the nanoscale could
    be modeled as "phases" although they are not related to the
    physical phases of solid, liquid or gas.
    - and so, as you zoom out to larger collections of the same
      substance, it loses those properties from the nanoscale
      configuration of matter, unless that fragile nanostructure is
      held consistent across the entire material.

- nature of duality vs agency, along geographic/philosophic dimensions
- an agent's degree of influence and perceived influence over
  environment, especially as it relates to some permanent state
  changes.
  - in particle systems which are high-dimensional and where the
    particles have agency and intentionality, phase changes among
    particles have a far greater capacity for effecting other
    particles in the system.
  - how did this section correlate to phase changes?

Social isolation correlates strongly with vulnerability, poverty,
mental illness and the inability to tap into local economic
opportunities.

- in space, no one can hear you scream.
- isolated individuals are more likely to quit or be fired at jobs
  - if someone systematically attacks your social connections or
    alters the frame of people in your 1&deg; and 2&deg; social
    boundaries, it severely constricts your options and level of
    awareness your friends and family have of your life.
    - when you are extremely isolated and something wonderful or
      traumatic happens in your life, no one will know.
      - you completely lose the network effect in life.
    - social networks and interactions should be
- blurb about abusive relationships

This particular postulate should be considered axiomatic.

- social isolation/connectedness (in/dependence and vulnerability)
- this isn't really something considering almost axiomatic, which
  definitely describes the other two...
- third: social isolation is quantifiable and almost always correlates
  with power. more isolated, less empowered.
  - isolated individuals are more susceptable to manipulation


The impact on connectedness and digital communications were quantified
in this 2013 paper from Cisco and MIT. Though "there did not seem to
be individuals on the extreme periphery of the network", those

#### Power *FROM* The People

This
[Revolution of Empowerment](https://github.com/dcunited001/dcunited001.github.io/blob/sources/_drafts/our-revolution-of-empowerment-engineering-diffusion-of-influence.md)
is a manifesto on using social physics informed by ethics, utility,
purpose and values. It's been nearly finished for about eight months
now. It covers use social physics driven by data-science to *EMPOWER*
people, instead of crippling them, terrifying them and, worst of all,
fueling surveillance-informed psychological torture. Utopian
applications of social engineering *always* sound so promising on
paper, but what we have in America is technology driven by malice,
fear and paranoia: hardly what social physics *could do* for the
average person. For most of those in poverty, the entire course and
cause of their plight, could they simply be empowered with what we are
all born with: the potential to leverage sociophysical energy to
transform our surroundings. (move: As someone with libertarian-leaning
ideas on civil rights, privacy and data-ownership, I hesitate to
enable the government in this regard because even the best intentions
go horribly awry.)


- {from article on math} furthermore, there are people who's mental
  state is the result of their life experience, either in the past or
  because of current conditions. There are many types of individuals
  who suffer with improper diagnosis because of isolation, abusive
  relationships, and many other reasons. Social data science can
  easily distinguish those individuals.
  - Part of the [Biocomplexity Institute](https://www.bi.vt.edu/) at
    Virginia Tech, the
    [Social and Decision Analytics Laboratory](https://www.bi.vt.edu/research/Social-and-Decision-Analytics-Laboratory)
    is...
    - While any widespread social data science without consent results
      in unsettling privacy issues, the only institutions with access
      to data needed for social data science are instead using it for
      control. In some cases, it is specifically used to exacerbate
      mental health problems. This results in major economic strain,
      regardless of whether the taxpayer, businesses or the family
      covers mental health costs.

Isolation causes or exacerbates mental illness. When isolation is
protracted, it severly restricts their medium and long-term mental
states via constriction of variety of experience and inbound social
signal. It shrouds people in a
[fog of war](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fog_of_war). If it really
does severly impact quality of life, couldn't we reduce unnecessary
budget deficits through means such as removing large drains on
publicly or privately financed healthcare. (It can definitely make a
difference. However, iatrogenic treatment has caused horrible
consequences in my own life.)

- social isolation can be measured, given some "normal" facebook
  user's 2-degree graph of friends for some definition of normal
  (casual but regular) social media usage
  - filter the friends by strength of connection to indentify edges
    sending and receiving inbound and outbound messages/interactions
    - measure the degree of reciprication and the variety of people
      forming the strongest recent connections
    - filter out all connections which do not fit some minimum of
      interaction threshold
    - this sparsifies the graph, filtering a dense graph and leaving
      only the most relevant connections
  - from here, the person's isolation can be measured using spectral
    graph theory
    - this independence can be measured in graph theory with
      kelman's transformation
    - see spectral graph theory
      [here](http://www.cs.elte.hu/~csiki/application_Kelmans.pdf),
      [here](http://www.math.ucsd.edu/~mtait/k-independent.pdf)
      - and [here](https://www.cs.elte.hu/math/phd_th/csiki.v2.pdf)
      - the details of this math is over my head btw

- this, of course, assumes the person is a "normal" facebook user,
  where the relevant 1-degree and 2-degree connections in the friend
  graph are all also "normal" users
  - this high-level algorithm could also work with clustered types of
    facebook users
    - yet, the degree in variation in how people use applications to
      communicate and their distribution of time/usage across multiple
      applications makes clustering extremely difficult.
    - at least, if a clustering algorithm is to enable the selection
      of users which fit some basis with quantifyable variation and
      some metric of confidence

- during and after segregation, social isolation created massive, but
  hard-to-see setbacks for the african american community. this
  strongly limited social mobility because african americans forged a
  disproportionately small amount of strong connections with
  influential people with social/financial capital.
  - this is especially hard to see if you don't experience it.
  - the exact consequences of this are difficult to see or prove, but
    it means opportunities for advancement and economic well being
    were consistently out of reach, even after segregation officially
    ended.
  - even though the law was fixed, minority communities had a greater
    average networking distance to the gatekeepers of economic
    opportunities (not all white people, but rich white people),
    though it's difficult to measure
  - this takes time to heal, though there is plenty of room for
    improvement, i think it has significantly improved over the
    previous three generations.

- in a purely digital world, manipulation of social media algorithms
  to exclude "undesirable" individuals could create disconnection
  among groups of people, defined logically instead of by ethnicity
  (let us NEVER do that).
  - i don't mean this to be compared to segregation
  - in a convergent social network that is increasingly less engaged
    in "real" interactions and more engaged in "virtual" interactions,
    where some interactions can be voluntarily or involuntarily
    censored via SEO/Social Media manipulation, this means that entire
    groups of people can become silenced or disenfranchised without
    even knowing it.

Semiolinguistic connectedness leads to a paradox where obvolution of
language, signs and images dramatically reduces the set of
possibilities. Information or connections assumed to be completely
invisible will be revealed for what it is regardless of how hard
people worked to suppress some of it, even if some of it was never
transmitted or spoken in plain langauge. This is especially true once
online identity validation is nearly universal or can be retroactively
resolved. People don't generate content or expend energy that isn't
relevant or meaningful.

In thermodynamic, biophysical and genetic systems, patterns of change
and entropy in configurational and conformational distributions
provide a metric measuring complex similarity metatypes of programs in
chaos. Using this, one can dilineate genetic programs and other
complex non-deterministic systems. Moreover, a formulation of this
metric *could provide a kind of digital signature*. It's design would
diverge from traditional digital signature methods and would likely
only serve to identify the nature and type of a program.

#### Does This Go Gamestate Look Random? Is Any Gamestate Random?

![Go Game Board](/img/posts/2017-10-21-speed-of-thought-twenty-postulates-of-social-physics/go-game-board.jpg)

For games like Go or Chess, can natural gamestates be sampled from a
uniform distribution of gamestates? Why would this deviate
significantly from the set of gamestates in novice or pro games? So a
probability distribution over the set of all gamestates should be
mostly sparse. Why is this? Because the moves that players choose are
tightly coupled the rules of the game. Metrics of similarity for
gamestates provided the basis for dilineation of functionally similar
gamestates that provided the basis for information compression in the
recent Go algorithm, enabling the game to be solved much sooner than
anticipated.

<!-- i "allegedly" talked to tatiana about the pythagorean triples
     problem. the major advancement enabling both Go and the
     [Boolean Pythagorean Triples](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boolean_Pythagorean_triples_problem)
     problem was the usage of information compression to condense the
     problem spaces.

     e.g. for Pyth triples:
       - 3^2 + 4^2 = 5^2
       - 2*(3^2 + 4^2 = 5^2)

     .... hmmmm, that's actually not true, so it's another
     inconsistency. am i remembering my triggered memory correctly?
     paul vasquez made it clear i was not to write about meeting
     her... but never why.

     but an article about the solution triggered dejavu and the
     solution does use information compression. other triggered
     memories involving math problems include menger sponge volume
     (0), matroids (the marriage problem), birdman 3D stereoscopic
     video composition (filming at the time, w/ change order in 2013),
     nucleotide edit distance, gravitational wave detection (from dual
     black hole event, though that's obvious) and others. it was like
     an IQ test after the menger sponge question.

     strange that i was never aware of most of this stuff. i would see
     an image and recall things i had never thought about before. only
     a few of the memories would provide me with insights about
     knowledge i could be certain was *correct* and did not exist
     within me. other times, there were many inconsistencies and facts
     would be incorrect, where i made dumbass mistakes, which i was
     stupidly overconfident about and only later discovered i was
     wrong. the quality, quantity and types of sensory content of
     these memories varies wildly: some contain other people and many
     contain no people, except me and her. we could not have possibly
     talked for ~36 hours.

     conveniently, if i were to ever say anything, people could
     instantly accuse me of being crazy. doubtless that *20% or more
     may have been real*, but the rest could not be true. simply keep
     me socially/financially pinned down for X months/years and the
     problem would probably take care of itself. strange how there
     were so many legally material aspects of these memories, like my
     subconscious contained some jungian dream archetype that
     practiced national security law on the side. they were not
     dreams. whatever happened to me, it would take care of 99.999% of
     the cases.

When people seat themselves at tables for a meal, they choose a seat
one at a time. When approaching the table, people naturally sort
themselves into an ordering that reveals some information about
whether choosing a seat is important to them. The first people to get
there fill the space naturally: if there are spatial constraints to
choosing less accessible seats, then people who deviate from common
courtesy reveal information. Sit closer to the center of the table and
you're more connected. Taking a less connected seat can reduce the
supply of adjecent seats with a physically reduced factor of
sociophysical friction: increased phsyical distance. Therefore,
because of the element of choice, the set of potential seating
arrangements is similarly not random.

> needed to resort to thermodynamics to understand.

Everything reveals information, but parsing incommplete and
inschematic information is usually prohibitively complex. look for
tightly coupled position, orientaion and change in field of view: when
the specific configuration starkly departs from natural non-coupled
sociophysical configuration, it shows. If you artificially randomize
everything you do and change your position, field of view and
orientation without justification, then people tightly coupled to your
behavior must do the same. This tight coupling reveals everything, but
false positives abound.

- in the above, position, field of view and orientation describe
  conformational changes.
  - configurational entropy is moreso about

As a sociophysical system progresses, you can keep track of the amount
of time specific "molecular" configurations of participants spent
connected. This forms a kind of combinatorially-derived entropy -- but
not thermodynamic entropy. It's closer to Shannon's informational
entropy, which measures entropy in a more symbolic space. The holonic
information molecules form local configurations where each node in a
group can have a different holonic composition of metatypes. Atoms are
easy to dilineate into a periodic table of elements and isotopes, but
holons have infinite variation, so it is only possible to reason about
similarity of metatype composition.

![Cyclohexane Conformations](/img/posts/2017-10-21-speed-of-thought-twenty-postulates-of-social-physics/cyclohexane-conformations.png)

#### Cyclohexane Rapidly Transitions Between Its Conformations

The frequency of cyclohexane conformations in a solution depends upon
the variance between the energy required to stabalize that
conformation and energy required to transition to each other state.
These transitions can be modeled by a discrete Markov chain. When you
see an abundance of one conformation with extremely low probability it
means the actual entropy of that solution is highly anomolous.

![Random Walk Along the Conformational Free Energy Landscape](/img/posts/2017-10-21-speed-of-thought-twenty-postulates-of-social-physics/free-energy-conformations.jpg)

#### A Random Walk Along the Conformational Free Energy Landscape

A molecule's state transitions follow a random walk on the curved
surface of the energy gradient the current state's Brownian motion
results from adjacent forces. All molecules are unique vibrations and
have specific conformational entry points when they are formed. As the
molecule persists, average motion should encourage it to gravitate
towards a vibration more typical for that type of molecule. This is
mostly informed by classical mechanics, so may not be 100% correct.

Groups of people in conversations, follow similar paths around
conformational transitions representing their current state

- (define a group's conformation as ... )

Within a sociophysical game, people modeled as molecules may alter
their local spatial arrangment, which more closely parallels
conformational entropy. From variance and change in conformation in a
group of people, you can infer information about the types of
interactions that will emerge from that group's conversation in the
coffee shop or at a bar. If the variance devates too strongly or the
rate of change increases too quickly, this indicates that something
new might happen. (Observing this when that conformation-state or
change in state has an interestingly low probability, leading to lower
entropy and perhaps indicating a skewed distribution.) If it is
important, you should proactively elicit reactions for more
information.

  knew in the past?
  - transition into how this resembles the phenomenon of entanglement

- within some entity, if the presence or structure of information is
  unclear, when can it be resolved? upon a new stimulis, whereby the
  reaction might only exhibit certain reaction-types given some
  specific structure of information.
  - therefore, entity exposure to previous interactions of holonic
    info particles reduces or expands the scope of possibilities when
    exposed to future particles. there is tight coupling between the
    entity's condition and both future and past events.
    - and an appropriate analogy for this is entanglement.

- Listening to a cannon blast in a stadium on every touchdown
  - when repetitive stimuli condition us to recognize and react to
    phenomena, we react to this phenomena by attaching our own
    information to the holonic particle form of information attached
    to physical stimuli.
    - when the cannon fires, at what point do people respond? when
      they hear it, since it travels at the speed of sound.
      - this also manifests physical wavelike phenomena: in a large

        brief (opening) where some people may subconsciously react the
        visual cues before they hear the conditioned stimulus.
  - even fans on campus not present at the game can know when a
    touchdown is scored or when the game ends.

- if information can be conceived as packets or particles, then when
  does the information take on particular forms
  - combining datums modeled by holons with lambda calculus
    - { quantum entanglement seems to be a manisfestation of a kind of
      probabilistic lambda calculus }
  - the physical manisfestation of the information is not meaningful
    until it develops a corresponding physical manisfestation in an
    information-processing agent.
    - therefore: metaphysical entanglement
    - this kind of entanglement can "reach back through time" in a
      way, without communication when the necessary details are
      predetermined by protocol or patterns of conditioned
      response.
      - information representations can effect each other through time
        and space, without direct physical connections.
      - this is because some information processing entities are
        autonomous.

    when exposed to physical phenomena that carries with it a

    inference.
    - if the stimulus is a holonic particle, then where does it exist?
    - can a message be conveyed with a single photon? no.
    - but we can't react to something until the entire holonic

        and be meaningful is only possible if these semiotic forms can
        be enumerated purely from a kernal of logic, a priori -- that
        can be known with certainty that the message will be
        understood. otherwise it's impractical and because of its
        utility, this is how aliens will decide to accelerate
        communication.
