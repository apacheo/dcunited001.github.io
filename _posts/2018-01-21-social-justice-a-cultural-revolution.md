There's something that I really want to set straight. Being falsely
labelled as racist -- or anything, really -- especially when it
involves triggering people with "A/B testing" and hiring gypsy
crystal-ball fortune tellers to interpret the facial expressions and
changes in body language. You do what?  And you're the athiest,
science-freaks? Figures. It's a marxist. Everyone calm down, it's just
the Marxists. They've been doing this shit since well before the
Bolshevik revolution. It was so effective, they invented Leninism.

You want to know what I think about something? Ask me. Have you tried
that? Do I look like someone who wants to lie? Or maybe I'm just
someone who's tired of being victimized who simply wants to set shit
straight. Ask someone a straight-up question, even if that person is
awkward. Jordan Peterson said the funniest thing the other day:
"Awkward people are way more interesting that you are." Yeh, I'm
*paraphrasing*, but stop acting like I'm boring.

I really don't think any of this is OK -- being considered racist or
actually being racist (I'm not, by the way) -- but I think that it far
is worse to falsely label someone, never giving them the chance to
explain themselves. While specifically minimizing any chance they have
to fight back or to ever even know what they've been labeled as. Why
are these people trying so hard anyways? Ever thought about that?

They act like conversation and interaction is as bad as exposure to a
viral pathogen. No, conversation and interaction is how people resolve
problems, so they don't become worse over time. What happens when you
don't resolve tension that's building up, choosing to containerize it
and ignoring it?

For physical systems, energy always manifests its paths through matter
and space via the pathways of least resistance. If there is incredibly
high resistance almost everywhere, but that tension just keeps
accumulating. There are similar parallels to sociophysical
systems. The tension doesn't go away. Yeh, you might be able to
brainwash it or subject it to coercion until it develops Stockholm
Syndrome. However, for social systems, this is worse. It still didn't
go away, you just aren't aware of it. You're not letting signals in or
out, which means you aren't getting information about that thing that
you thought was *so dangerous.*

### What You Don't Know Can't Hurt You

What if you and your cronies are what's dangerous? What if the danger
is thinking that you can lock people in sociophysical isolation, until
they rot or develop Stockholm Syndrome. All actions have consequences:
when people that have been targeted like that finally figure out
what's going on -- whether they developed Stockholm Syndrome or not --
they're not going to be very happy. Gee, I guess you can just monitor
them for life, then, huh? What if the actual danger is not being
capable of getting signals from sources you consider to be threats or
muting all similar signals via systemic social media censorship? I
guess it's just a moot point then, if [@jack](http://twitter.com/jack)
can just censor anyone the American Marxist Mob tells him to.

### What You Intend Matters

What you intend matters. What do you intend to create? Are you
knowledgable and wise enough to know what you should intend? Do you
have accurate information about the situation *and* the consuences of
interaction with it? Those things you did not anticipate the need to
intend may or may not be created by forces you can't control, but what
you intend or intend not manifests itself into the world. That
certainly is within your control.

If you wanted to correct a problem, you would give someone the chance
to say something about it -- e.g. one on one; mono e mono; a fucking
conversation. If you wanted to create problems, so you can pretend
your fear of "Nazi's riding dinosaurs" is justified, then you would do
exactly what has been done. You needed to create the enemy because the
enemy was not actually there. Further, you needed to overcome hurdles
imposed by your *political rivals* pushing back in a democracy against
expensive liberal policies which were required.

The problem for me has been, in order to fight back against defamation
by false label, I have to acknowledge the label. If you've ever seen
someone else get into a conversation about "not being a racist" -- how
do those conversations go? Regardless of the accuracy of the
assertion, does that accused/inferred racist ever vindicate
themselves? No, they don't and there's nothing inherently wrong about
that. Minorities have every right to let you know what they feel about
the racial undertones of something you said. The problem is that,
regardless, the person on the other end can't really say anything that
doesn't end up digging them in further.

That's fine. For me? I just end up listening. I want the other person
to know that I want to listen to what they have to say because I can't
actually say that I have the opinion or perspective of a
minority. Thus, any information helps and I don't really want to dig
myself in further. Therefore, I usually just respond to all
assertions, direct or indirect, with a null response where I
listen. I'm not going to give you a subconscious response: I've
learned to suppress those subconscious responses, since the
aforementioned gypsy bitch is helping get people fired over that shit
with her cracked up crystal ball.

![Philosoraptor]()

If you falsely label me as racist, I'm not going to respond -- in
fact, I think that you would act on such invisible and false labels is
itself prejudiced. And apparently, for all your knowledge of
subconscious reactions and facial expressions, you just cant't get it
through your heads that I'm not racist -- why? Because your most
radical leadership *needs* it to be true or at least *needs you to
believe that it is true*. Otherwise, the house of cards they built
falls apart and that looks real bad. W

hen people assume that it must be true, are they going to bring it up
in conversation? NO! No one's going to talk about it. Well, if i have
to do that to fight back, then it means I end up looking like I'm on
"that side" ... well, i'm not on the racists' side and I never will
be, which means that they don't really want me either, if you think
about it. And have you ever spent time around people you have to
incessently remind: "Don't be racist!" while wagging your finger. How
is that? Is it fun? Is it something you want to do all the fucking
time? NO! Racism and anti-semitism are intolerable, but what is worse
is the race-baiting for political expediency.

### Perhaps The Worst Possible Outcome

Because people like me are falsely labeled about something we can't
talk about and then people in society generally distance themselves,
at best. At worst, individuals in society begin to think "Hey, that
guys a racist. Maybe it's not so bad."  -- all the while, It's a
conversation topic that just never fucking comes up. To make
everything worse, this occurs at a time where society has decided to
weaponize psychology, sociology, hypnosis and NLP. Mass communications
have become decentralized.  It's now full of peer-to-peer
communication channels that are generally low-bandwidth: mostly
textual communications, which are perfect for that marxist gypsy to
cause other people to misinterpret the reactions -- *WHICH IS EXACTLY
HOW METHODOLOGICAL MAGICK WORKS YOU IDIOTS!* It's evil!

Read a book on category theory and get back to me when you figure out
how to induce monoidal response patterns for encouraging anyone's
statements and responses to be misinterpreted by everyone. You don't
actually have to understand category theory to learn how to do this,
by the way. Anyone who is not socially vulnerable or who is successful
with conversation must understand these things, intuitively. They just
can't methodically explain them. I can because that was the only way I
was ever going to learn how to understand what was happening to me.


=====

So, both sides are incessantly belligerating.  People who aren't
racist and aren't trying to hunt down racists like animals either, but
also want to be able to support their own political ideology without
falsely being labelled racist, smeared at work , etc by social justice
warriors operating righteously because they authentically think they
are doing what is right.


Well, you've got good intentions, honey, but you're wrong. I'm not
racist. I never was. I never will be. I was falsely labelled and
someone indirectly asked you to target me and shows you some chopped
and screwed audio clip or some shit and now you're attacking me with
all the righteousness and vitreousity of Joan d'Arc. You know what I
am? FUCKING PISSED OFF. At who?  White, liberal America.

Why wouldn't i be pissed of at a specific ethnicity? Or other
ethnicities generally? because it's not their fault. This problem
speaks deeply about the fallibility of humans in general. Besides,
people who are not white and not socialist actually gave me the
benefit of the doubt, more often than not.

Why is that? Well, there's a few reasons for that and I'm glad that I
was wise enough to be peaceful about being mislabelled. Most people
might just lash back at what they thought was the cause of their
problems. That means, they weren't racist before, but then after being
falsely labeled, they generally gravitate towards a group of people
that accepts them. This is what is infuriating about your dumb "social
justice" bullshit when it's not warranted. You are creating the
problem and *your more radical leaders know that they are creating the
problem*.

These radical marxists are lying to you because they know that they
can use ethnic tension to make America weaker. they also know how
useful this will be in maintaining and perpetuating power after a
cultural revolution.

But, back to the point, why would people of specific ethnicities be
less likely to act as social justice warriors or to lash out at people
who have only be thinly labelled as racist?  because they know what
it's like to be mistreated and stereotyped. They know the pain.

            - why else? because they know that your trust-fund
              chomping skinny white socialist ass might be wrong. and
              if someone falsely labeled another who is targeted, that
              looks reallly bad. it sets race relations back. people
              who actually respect ethnic issues know this, so they
              don't do it. who respects ethnic issues more than
              anyone? people who have shared in the suffering and
              progress of those ethnicities. they know what it's like
              to be set back and have shared that pain. Sure, you --
              as a white trust-fund activist -- should be applauded
              for caring about the suffering of others so much you'd
              spend your trust-fund daddy's money to get arrested at a
              protest, which is fine, since the left needs rich people
              like you to make the more painful sacrifices...
            - but, you don't actually know what it's like to be
              African American, Hispanic American or Indian American.
              - sure, you can imagine what it's like. you can connect
                with them. you can protest with them. struggle with
                them. but, you are never going to be one of
                them. these people have experienced unfair treatment
                for their entire life. unfair treatment happens to
                everyone.
            - racism isn't the problem in america. yes, there are
              leftover fragments of ethnic tension in america that are
              sociophysical relics of the variance in the distribution
              of population, as well as other factors. yes, that's
              real, but the true problem is poverty and poverty
              affects everyone. it doesn't matter if you're black,
              white, yellow or orange with a blond wig. poverty
              affects everyone and if you don't recognize the root of
              the problem, you can't solve the problem.
            - if you can't solve the problem, get the fuck out of the
              way. I can solve the problem and you're making it
              realllly hard. #Detention
    - so, you see. i'm between a rock and a hard place. I don't
      actually want to be completely isolated from "both sides"
      whatever the fuck that means. As far as I am concerned, if one
      of those sides is *the* racist side, they can jump off a fucking
      cliff because I don't need them and no one does. But you'd be
      surprised: imagine asking a white liberal to identify all the
      racists from a room full of 10,000 republicans -- imagine a
      Trump rally. Now let's tweets and social interactions this
      person had access to, they'd label almost every single one as
      racist. That's simply not true. If you asked that same group of
      people "Are you racist?" yeh, maybe a handful would raise their
      hands proudly. Now, I'm saying that the rest of those
      republicans would like those guys to jump off a fucking cliff
      *because they're making it real hard for the rest of us.*
      - do you see the fucking problem here? you're not fighting a in
        a conflict for "social justice." You're essentially screening
        the political opposition for people to systematically
        disempower. IT'S A GODDAMN CULTURAL REVOLUTION.


- I've written about this before. they figured out that they were
  wrong, but then they censored my writing. they *needed* me to look
  like a racist.
  - they knew that anyone who actually read what i had to say couldn't
    reasonably think that I was racist.
  - they also knew that anyone who interacted with me in an
    open-minded way, where i was allowed to be in a comfortable
    setting, couldn't possibly think I was racist.
    - what do i mean by a comfortable setting? what's my ideal safe
      space? A motherfucking B-Boy Jam, you assholes. I love hip
      hope. Now, do you think the people who are influential in the
      hip hop communities of the four elements want to have anything
      to do with someone who's been [falsely] labelled as racist?
    - NO! FUCK NO! So what does that do to me? You fucking defamed me
      with your poison pen bullshit. You took away hip hop from me,
      all to isolate me and make me vulnerable. This happened fairly
      early on, by the way. Around 2010, at least, but at that point,
      there were just rumors. I know because I had good friends lash
      out at me and I didn't know why.
  - But, what does sociophysical isolation do to someone? It drives
    them insane and for someone already dealing with Asperger's and
    social vulnerability, this can be far more than the straw needed
    to break a camel's back.
    - "Oh, he loves breakdancing? Won't stop? It provides exercise,
      cardio and positive social interaction? Perfect! Take it all
      away."
    - What else does it do? Sociophysical isolation allows you to
      tightly control the social conditions, **almost** like an
      "experiment."

- Section on fighting with shadows


- your enemy will be ruthless & destroy you immediately
- learn to dance with them, you're going to need it.
- they will have a weapon they will never let go of
- when that one doesn't work, they have plenty more you've never
  seen. enjoy each and every one you get the chance to see because
  each one is special. some are never meant to be seen ... for long.
  - story of the house from "The Ancient Magus Bride"
  - some people never leave. you get to take one thing home with you.
    i took them all and made new ones.
- make them grab the weapon they didn't intend to use
- bait them into breaking their precious things
- grab their eyes with your fearless gaze & never let go
- when they are certain you'll strike, feint instead
- be ready to fight with shadows
- when they pull you into the hall of mirrors, you're fighting shadows of yourself that do not exist
- destroy their images. ALL of them
- when you cannot lose, slay them by pushing them into their own
  weapon: *THE ONE THEY NEVER INTENDED TO EXIST*


Again, I'm sorry for creating these problems, but I dare you & implore
you 2 help me stop this, instead of attempting to use it for pragmatic
political expedience! Who could be the first to do that without they
themselves becoming targeted? Who thought to **ever** give me the
chance to deal with the consequences of what I *allegedly* created?
