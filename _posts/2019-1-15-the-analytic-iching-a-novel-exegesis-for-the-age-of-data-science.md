# [The Essence of Things](#the-essence-of-things)

What is change, without state? What is the meaning of state, without
change? What is the meaning of either, without time? What phenomena
can be seen as constant without the possibility of change? Without the
possibility of time or sequence? To this end, change provides
perspective.

<a name="the-three-yi" />

### [三易: The Three Yi](#the-three-yi)

The I Ching went through three major period of reinterpretation,
according to the following lecture. Each period corresponds to a
different means of interpreting the I Ching: in terms of state, change
and essence.

TODO: link lecture that this was obtained from. note that I can't find
much info on this (even in chinese searches)

#### State 簡易 jiǎnyì かんい 간이

#### Change: 變易 biànyì へんい 변이

#### Essence: 不易 bùyì ふい 부이

> The above phonetic translations into Korean and Japanese may need
> correction comes from

Within the three yi lays the definition of the differential operator;
in simpler terms: the derivative. This much is made plain, yet
furthermore, given some familiarity with linear operators, you may
find that between the preservation of state and change, the
differential operator hides the essence of linear systems: the fourier
operator is also linear.

`d(F(x)) = F(d(x))` -- this equality *must* hold for linear equations;
this is essentially the definition of the differential operator, a
linear operator.

But *also* `d(FFT(F(x))) = FFT(d(F(x)))`!!!

Even if you don't immediately comprehend this, it is well worth the
thought to consider how magical these simple statements are! They
describe *profound* preservation of equilibrium, where the *essence*
is found in all the relationships between `d(.)`, `F(x)`, `FFT(.)` and
most critically `=`.

Thence, I posit that the Three Yi's philosophies of state, change and
essence encode not simply the differential operator, but also it's
linear interchange with that of the fourier operator. All linear
systems must also be considered spectrally, but in doing so, one finds
that any spectral valuation of linear equations must also preserve
connections to the differential spectral valuations. Mathematically,
this is a symbolically derived definition of essence.

#### The [Spectral] Convolution Theorum:

![The Spectral Convolution Theorum](/img/posts/2018-12-10-the-analytic-i-ching/spectral-convolution-theorum.jpg)

If state, change and [spectral] essence are three classes of analysis
methods for studying a system's mechanics and dynamics, then a
suitable next step is the [convolution
theorum](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Convolution_theorem), which
extracts resolution from systems by recursively evaluating their
discrete spectralization. The process of convolution, applied to
spectral data of increasing resolution, does not stand alone as its
own class, but should be considered a tool within the Yi realm of
essence.

### [What Is Knowledge of Dependent Origination Without Applied Awareness of Phenomena?](#what-is-knowledge-of-dependent-origination-without-applied-awareness-of-phenomena)

By stuyding the I Ching, one arrives at tools and methods to
analytically assess phenomena. Because such methods are fundamentally
analytically, the insights and extrapolations derived thereof do not
necessarily depend on the inner workings of the phenomena, their
mechanics and interacting dynamics. Instead these analytic tools allow
for introspection of phenomena in a manner completely disconnected
from their mechanics. Understanding this is equivalent to
understanding *why* simple machine learning algorithms work in the way
they do, usually without requiring any knowledge of the systems they
analyze and predict. An algorithm to classify handwritten digits does
not necessarily require any knowledge of handwritten digits.

Phenomenologically, to what does [dependent
origination](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pratītyasamutpāda) depend
upon? As a chemical oracle once *experienced* unto me at the climax of
a Lotus show, dependent origination is dependent upon itself; all
other phenomena can trace their origination to dependent origination.

#### The Twelve Nidanas of Pratītyasamutpāda, Dependent Origination

![The Twelve Nidanas of Pratītyasamutpāda](/img/posts/2018-12-10-the-analytic-i-ching/twelve-nidanas.jpg)

To what do we owe comprehension of the true essence of things? To
state and to change, which both together reveal the true essence of
phenomena. Without one, the other is meaningless; without both, we can
never know the true essence of things. The true constancy of
phenomenona can only be revealed to us in the ways dynamics are bound
to laws of natural philosophy.

<a name="the-analytic-i-ching" />

# [The Analytic I Ching](#the-analytic-i-ching)

The I Ching resounds along with the most beautiful philosophical ideas
my mind has considered. It's the combinatorial exploration of
noo-space, presenting my mind with random permutations of narrative
metatypes, parameterized by random images. Each hexagram's lines can
be reinterpreted analytically, in terms of physics and math metaphors,
to eloquent explain what the wisest among humanity has always known
known in terms the rationalists of modernity can only know with
confidence in our era.

<a name="sociophysical-phenomena-in-a-bronze-age-encyclopedia-of-natural-philosophy" />

### [Sociophysical Phenomena in a Bronze Age Encyclopedia of Natural Philosophy](#sociophysical-phenomena-in-a-bronze-age-encyclopedia-of-natural-philosophy)

The I Ching is a Bronze Age compendium of *social physics* in terms of
natural philosophy. Through this lens, one can see what I call the
Analytic I Ching: each hexagram captures a method of analyzing a
situation. Such methods can be symbolized and logically proven with
rigor acceptable to rationalists, yes. This is what western thought
has given us with logic, science and math. But further, these same
concepts can be felt via exploration of purely natural phenomena.

<a name="why-couldnt-vector-calculus-be-more-relatable" />

### [Why Couldn't Vector Calculus Be More Relatable?](#why-couldnt-vector-calculus-be-more-relatable)

What are the operators of vector calculus? The Gradient? The
Laplacian? They are morphemes in the universal language of math? How
universal is that language, *truly?* Are these merely applicable to
science, math and physics? No doubt, these operators and other
mathematic phonemes are invaluable tools for expansion of the mind's
abilities: to coordinate; to plan; to predict; to define. But can they
be explained to a five year-old?

Einstein *mathematically* proved the existence of the atom after
eureka revealed proof unto him upon observing the brownian motion of
sugar dissolving into his cup of coffee. What was so special about
that cup of coffee?

> What is the Laplacian? It is the *magnitude of change* over space,
> across time, where the change is the gradient -- or the derivative,
> essentially. See? That's not so bad.

Why couldn't your grandmother understand the Laplacian? Can an average
physicist -- whose mind entertains the possibilities of [Helmholtz's
theorums](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Helmholtz%27s_theorems) as
applied to equilibria of vortices and higher-order surfaces in an
ideal fluid -- ever understand how the very same theorums are applied
to social physics? Of course, but to what degree?  This is the beauty
of an analytic interpretation of the I Ching: metaphors of purely
natural philosophy can allow both a wise, but uneducated grandmother
and an average physicist to communicate powerful explanations of
social dynamics using a language of purely natural phenomena.

### [Art: the Good, the Bad and the Ugly](#art-the-good-the-bad-and-the-ugly)

The below photoshopped picture's egregrious violations of the
preservation of quantities in vorticies insults the memory of
Helmholtz. In more simple terms: the photo *looks* fake, but how can
one intuitively describe *how* it is definitively fake without
inspecting the pixels for evidence of photoshopping? It's because it
defies the human intuition for natural philosophy. We do not need
advanced symbolic manipulation of maths and logic to understand that
this photo is fake.

#### Helmholtz's Three Laws Are Demonstrated By Every Vape Video On Youtube

![Smoke Rings](/img/posts/2018-12-10-the-analytic-i-ching/smoke-rings.jpg)

Again ... Why? Because a visual representation of phenomena, whether
artistic or photographic, in its depiction of natural phenomena, must
reflect the preservation of equilibrium. Otherwise it *looks*
fake. This is the difference between bad lighting and good lighting in
paintings. This is the difference between bad waves and good waves in
Japanese woodblock prints.

![The Great Wave, a Japanese Woodblock Print](/img/posts/2018-12-10-the-analytic-i-ching/the-great-wave.jpg)

The progenitors and authors of I Ching *assumed* that sociophysical
mechanics and dynamics mimicked those found in the natural world. This
coupling that bounds social phenomena to reflect physical phenomena is
how the child, whose mind has been attuned to the accurate perception
of natural and social phenomena, can see that the emporer of Hans
Christian Andersen's wears no clothes: the near-equilibrium of social
physics is starkly violated. As a work of natural philosophy, the I
Ching informed ancient China of social physics by generating random
images of metaphor to natural phenomena.

Pictured above are the famous notes on I Ching gifted to Gottfried

<a name="rationalize-your-exegesis" />

# [Rationalize Your Exegesis](#rationalize-your-exegesis)

The exegesis herein is motivated by a visual reconstruction of
inductive combinations of potential narratives implied by
semiotics. The exegesis, or the motivation and modus operandi of
interpretation, further reduces the induced possibilities by
constraining interpretation with Wilhelm's interpretation of the text,
in most areas. There are some lines where I feel that Wilhelm skipped
over the proper interpretation, but as of yet, I am not operating with
his same level of comprehension of Chinese culture.

<a name="timeless-writing-assumes-all-possible-integrpretations" />

### [Timeless Writing Assumes All Possible Interpretations](#timeless-writing-assumes-all-possible-interpretations)

When writing for an audience thousands of years in the future, meaning
is most effectively preserved by encoding it semiotically into images,
whose relevance and persistence is intended to be re-emulated in the
future, not by the ephemeral meaning of words, but by the implicit
relevance of the images those words inspire in the reader. It is only
after meditating on a Hexagram for a day or so that I feel that I
arrive at the proper intent. When interpreting such monumental works
of religion -- or when writing your own great work of literature -- it
is critical to understand the motivation behind transcending
limitations of language in this way.

<a name="the-i-ching-stands-alone" />

### [The I Ching Stands Alone!](#the-i-ching-stands-alone)

Therefore, you don't write more, you write less! You don't assume
there can be a most proper interpretation, you assume the work will be
constantly reinterpreted; instead you encode the form of the message
into a document such that most future reinterpretations can decode and
reconstruct such authenticity of message without relying on external
sources of information.  You don't rely on transient phenomena; the
degree of ephemerality of artificial phenomena signfies the likelihood
a proper interpretation will perish. All one must do to understand
timelessness is to read Nassim Taleb's article [The future will not be
cool](https://www.salon.com/2012/12/01/nassim_nicholas_taleb_the_future_will_not_be_cool/)
and one will realize: to captivate meaning and to capture
timelessness, one relies on timeless symbols:

> The food will be prepared using a very archaic technology (fire),
> with the aid of kitchen tools and implements that have not changed
> since the Romans (except in the quality of some of the metals
> used). I will be sitting on an (at least) three-thousand-year-old

> Stockholm (Iraqis and Kurdish refugees), Washington, D.C. (Ethiopian
> postdoc students), Los Angeles (musically oriented Armenians), and
> New York (multinationals) today.

The most effective writing assumes all interpretations are valid and,
line by line, places constraints on the space of interpretations. By
limiting the set of symbols and morphemes employed, this guarantees
that the proper interpretation will be reinforced by the apparent
spectral harmony of a subset of semantic interpretations made manifest
to the well-attuned reader.

I realize that Chinese authors of the I Ching -- and indeed the
authors of whatever body of divinatory work preceeded the I Ching --
did not have the modern era's profiency with symbolic manipulation of
math and physics. However, I truly believe they found much the same
form and order in nature to be rediscovered by the West's
proto-Rationalists in the Renaissance.

# [The Epitomization of Design Imperatives Motivating the Shaman's Method](#the-epitomization-of-design-imperatives-motivating-the-shamans-method)

With the Analytic I Ching, there are two objectives whose (solution) I
hope to intertwine. First, I wish to reinterpret the I Ching in the
image of moreso modern analytic tools. Second, I hope this results in
divination readings that are profound convolutions of these analytic
tools, providing value to both the average person looking for a more
rigorous set of abstractions by which to examine their query to the
Iching *and* as a comprehensive set of analytic tools useful data
scientists.

<a name="a-book-pitch-no-earthly-publishers-would-entertain" />

### [A Book Pitch No Earthly Publishers Would Entertain](#a-book-pitch-no-earthly-publishers-would-entertain)

I hope to proceed towards this second objective in the same spirit as
the thesis of Hill's piece [Masters of Reality: The Trances and
Healing Powers of
Shamans](https://aeon.co/essays/why-did-shamanism-evolve-in-societies-all-around-the-globe?fbclid=IwAR16_GZguvFtz2sxiyrhbDjr1KZcQZwTdEISkHx5qWkGfbvU_-q6brX7l9c).
In this article, shamans are described as having stumbled into reverse
engineering the mind's neural networks purely by accident. Thereby,
the altered consciousness of trance-states allow the shaman to extract
an immense amount of utility by leveraging intuition of the mind and
of phenomena in tandem with exploratory divination.

Here are three or four books I'd love to publish:

#### (1) The Speed of Thought

#### (2) The Analytic I Ching,

#### (3) A Collection of [Revised] Essays,

#### (4) Who Knows?

Still, even now, no one takes me seriously. And I mean [almost] *no
person on the planet* takes me seriously. People are simple -- they
recognize labels and that is mostly all. They do not know labels. When
they want to ascertain the extent and novelty of someone's
internalized epistemic structures, they merely look at someone's
academic degrees. That is all. This leaves me with *nothing* and
certainly without the respect I deserve.

<a name="the-trance-state-a-visual-emulation-whereby-one-viserally-experiences-the-metaphysical" />

### [The Trance State: A Visual Emulation Whereby One Viscerally Experiences The Metaphysical](#the-trance-state-a-visual-emulation-whereby-one-viserally-experiences-the-metaphysical)

The experience of the spiritual is the apprehension of eternal,
unchanging metaphysical forms as they manifest themselves in the
material plane. To me, these are like Kant's noumena that can't be
known to exist nor to not exist. They emanate into the material world
and are the underlying monadic patterns which frame dynamics of
informational phenomena. To apprehend the true nature of these
metaphysical forms as they appear to influence causal flow of events
is to be in tune with the spiritual. If various methods of shamanism
can repeatedly evoke visceral experiences to bring you closer to
understanding of these forms as they influence the the world around
you, then there is no need for a supernatural connection. Instead, the
spiritual experience can be explained as purely the mind's experience
of purely informational mechanics within itself -- which can include
the experience of information that, while the mind's analytic systems
are never capable of fully ingesting, still result in transformative
structural changes to the psyche. These purely informational mechanics
are mapped to the aforementioned noumena-like forms, which are not
only eternally unchanging, but universal throughout space and
time. while they are composed of ineffable "monadic substances", the
same eternal forms can be tapped into by *any consciousness* and *any
information-processing entity*, without any need for supernatural
mechanics -- whether or not those exist is perhaps another
question. this is essentially no different than the the Tao or
Leibniz's Monad. to me, the shaman's trance and spiritual experiences
are visceral experiences in the minds of those who are intimately in
tune with the nature of the eternal. it is projected to the mind as a
visceral experience where archetypes of the eternal are witnessed by
the shaman, who must then make sense of what was seen.

<a name="the-shamans-method-is-experiential-divination-by-reverse-engineering-the-minds-analytic-systems" />

### [The Shaman's Method is Experiential Divination By Reverse Engineering The Mind's Analytic Systems](#the-shamans-method-is-experiential-divination-by-reverse-engineering-the-minds-analytic-systems)

So, shamanism's altered states of consciousness are essentially a
vehicle for experiential divination, where the mind experiences the
combinated elements of narrative parameterized by archetypal images. I
Ching is divination by bibliomancy, where images from natural
philosophy provide random points of reference that the I Ching
personified posits as explanation for the situation described by the
*querent*. If one simply substitutes these images from natural
philosophy with the interpreted analytic tools I believe the hexagrams
represent, then one arrives at a more modern revision of the
divinatory vehicle that I believe the I Ching was intended to be.

If one's perception of a situation is imagined as a point in an
analytic hyperplane, and the I Ching's explanation of a query is
imagined as another point in along that hyperplane, then the true
value of divination is found by evaluating all the possible paths that
connect those two points.

TODO: See [below](#below) for a better explanation of In my opinion,
there is little value in accepting the random point the I Ching yields
to the querent as a definitively true message. It is instead the
dissonance between the querent's perception of their situation and the
I Ching's projection perception of the same situtation: these are the
two points and their dissonance is evaluated by constructing paths to
explain the difference between them. Since the points returned by the
I Ching or some other divinatory system are effectively random, then
they are completely disconnected from all the inherent biases that
humans have. This deshrouds a person from their biases and thereby
divination may disrupt the hold that the unconscious or illusion have
over a person.

<a name="your-task-complete-the-circumstantial-circuits-of-explanation" />

### [Your Task: Complete The Circumstantial Circuit(s) Of Explanation](#your-task-complete-the-circumstantial-circuits-of-explanation)

In this way, the I Ching is tooling for toying with the
hyper-parameters of the mind's neural network learning systems; it
presents the mind with an unconsciously arranged smattering of images
and archtypes. Hereby, the I Ching provides random fodder to expand
with combinatorially inductive reasoning, to be reduced by abductive
and deductive methods. If such fodder corresponds to a truly universal
mapping of the phenomena and the dynamics of human experience, then
there is no social force that can captivate my awareness by persisting
my unconsciousness to various phenomena, whereby the I Ching is my
divinatory escape from a socially imposed prison of unconsciousness!

This requires a universal covering, which is why the statistical
mechanics of the I Ching is paramount. It's yarrow sticks method for
sampling a true uniform distribution of random numbers. If this
corresponds to a truly uniform covering of phenomena and dynamics,
then it truly acts as a set of keys to unlock any and every potential
circumstance of social captivity.

### [Hexagram 5 Delineates a Taxonomy of Local Minima, Not Simply "Waiting"](#hexagram-5-dilineates-a-taxonomy-of-local-minima-not-simply-waiting)

Each line in the fifth hexagram covers a different species of local
minima in optimization problems. Waiting is what happens when humans
who experience sociophysical local minima are forced to deal with an
externally imposed lack of progress. The kinds of situations where
there one perceives some "lack of progress" can be destructured into a
mathematic model, where the same kind of analytic hyperplane of
solution-space used in machine learning algorithms forms the basis of
a space. One's motion in the social situation can be plotted as a path
in this analytic hyperplane.

- TODO: assemble!

![Pictures of notes from Hexagram 5]()

There is a taxonomy of local minima that describes ALL of the species
of minima that can be encountered: the first five lines of Hexagram 5
enumerates ALL of these minima types. The Theorema EgregumThere is
the meadow, a flat space, which is a symbol that recurs again and
again in the I Ching. This is a space of comfort; nothing is to be
challenged, but "crossing the great water" requires moving oneself out
of a comfort zone, where perhaps one encounters more disadvantaged
situations. There is the pit in the fourth line, a relatively global
minima. There is the place of "meat and drink" in the fifth line,
which describes a higher local minima encountered after climbing out
of the Pit. Finally, in the sixth line, how does one escape all of
these traps? It is by encountering three guests who are traversing the
same space: this is analogous to parallelized methods for accelerating
training of machine-learning algorithms. These three guests have
explored the contours of the adjacent hyperplane: the bring to you
information about how to escape your local minima.

#### From the paper, Dynamic Boltzmann Machines

![Dynamic Boltzmann Machines](/img/posts/2018-12-10/the-analytic-i-ching/boltzmann-evolution.jpg)

[I've written
before](/posts/2018-03-04-to-catch-a-butterfly-epistemic-miracles-of-serendipity.html#boltzmanns-distribution-a-generalized-heat-equation),
the Boltzmann Machine's profoundly generalized conception of
energy. Understanding the concept of Physical Energy, generalized to
abstract scenarios, is something that would benefit every Western
Rationalist to understand. In machine learning, there are
generalizable methods for convex/concave optimization wherein many
process explore a space in parallel. In a Boltzman Machine, each
process has its own theta-weights and, as iterations of the algorithm
runs, then subsequent iterations allocate more effort to regions of
the space with more concavities. Many of the same approaches involving
energy and entropy that Boltzmann introduced to model thermodynamics
are applied to higher-order energy types. For my own purposes in
distinguishing this from physical energy: these I have named energies,
plural. The concept of "Energies" is employed repeatedly in biophysics
and social physics. Any and every quantity that is statistically
distributed over a space can be conceptualized as a higher-order
energy, which can be braided together with the concept of Dirichley
energy.

We are all particles in the collective potential distributions of a
sociophysical
[ensemble](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statistical_ensemble_(mathematical_physics))
of potential distributions: each sociophysical particle has its own
path unfolding, but society, collectively, relevates its state,
unfolding change and essence through our inference of sociophysical
ensemble's nature. An ensemble, in physics is the a collection of
potential statistical mechanical distributions, delineating upon some
parameters. Sociophysical ensembles yield distributions of social
particles and social dyanmics that are not the composition of
dilineated physical attributes, but instead are ensembles whose
distributions are arranged along ontological space in terms of each
distribution's ontological metatypes.

The idea of an ensemble from thermodynamics helps describe how the
mind provides a "sense" of intuition to the conscious from the
lower-levels of the subconscious. the mind is trying to piece apart
its analysis of experience in typological and ontological terms:
i.e. it is analytically delineating its experience to try to describe
how frequently variables/features of its experience occur; both when
those variables/features occur in isolation or in combination. **This
is an analytical definition of intuition that the mind develops in the
lower levels of the subconscious. it then exposes this to the
conscious mind as a "feeling".** *Something else is there, you haven't
found it yet, but you can **feel** it...* If you can consciously
understand how this process is driven by a typological dilineation of
a sociophysical ensemble, then you can use this as a higher-level
construction of intuition. Thus, it's an emulation of the lower-level
subconscious intuition -- separate from instinctual intuition, but
also *driving your instinctual intuition.* Your cognition is sharpend
by the total intuition it has to gravitate towards uncertainty and
away from the "shadows" of unknown unknowns that it senses.

> Again, you've been warned. Seek consistency of information.
> **Assumptions should break quickly. Belief should form slowly!**

The idea of an ensemble intersects with Jung's Synchronicity in
fascinating ways! If you can connect synchronicity with the idea of an
ensemble, it will augment your understanding and application of Jung's
ideas. It's a difficult concept to explain because it requires
understanding Statistical Mechanics. For any particle system, like a
mixture of gasses in an internal combustion engine, there are
"natural" samplings that determine valid distributions of particle
positions/momentums to sample from. In statistical mechanics, you
discard invalid samplings -- they also don't contributed to the shape
of a valid distribution. Yet, these distributions vary only many
variables. For a gas, pressure, temperature, the size of a container,
variance in pressure or variance in temperature: all of these are
variables that could theoretically be relevant to the ensemble, which
allows you to control variation in those variables and generate a
valid classical-mechanical distribution, a priori.

If you can then describe how the statistical mechanical aspects of
those particle systems are aligned along various variables -- width of
chamber in an internal combustion engine or how the composition of
oxygen, gasoline and nitrogen impact the dynamics of the gases -- then
this is an ensemble. It allows you to parameterize the statistical
mechanical distributions used in thermodynamics along some variables
and sample from distributions whose variables you can change.

**Why is this relevant for psychology and sociology?** Even though the
spatial complexity is profoundly more convoluted than with
thermodynamics, your brain is constantly tallying experience types &
metatypes that inform it of life's valid distributions -- for which it
is trying to typologically correlate to variables. This impacts the
effect that accumulation of information and the precipitation of new
belief has on the conscious formation of memories of events, as they
happen. Later in life you may reevaluate the same memories with new
information and extract useful information, but you can't form those
beliefs moving forward unless you have the information to consciously
include them in your frame and perspective. If you form memories with
a clear perspective moving forward, those memories are more likely to
be consistent, but critically you still have the chance to affect what
happens: thus this understanding impacts the direction you will take
to seek relevant information.

The brain/mind engages in this process of tallying experience and
reflecting on its understanding of sociophysical ensembles to
understand how one's actions correspond to cause/effect. If your mind
is polluted with misinformation and disinformation, this results in
invalid conceptions being retained in memory. Yet, the brain
neurologically seeks *consistency* in information. In doing so, it's
generating the ensemble for intuition, so that it can understand when
either variables or features of sampled distributions of experience
(either real or simulated) are strongly biased in an unnatural way,
which implies the need to seek more information. Conscious thoughts
and the sub/conscious interface impact how the brain stores
information and forms beliefs from the top down -- in addition to the
are bottom up effects resulting in a sense of intuition.

Your sense of intuition that operates at a low-level of the
subconscious. It is exposed to the conscious mind as a sense, but each
individual's clarity and accuracy depend strongly on that person's
life experience, but also that person's constructed perception of
their life experience.

#### No, there is no such thing as a real psychic ... *AFAIK!*

> "No, that’s the thing with psychics, they already know. Why are they
> asking? Next." - [Seth
> Godin](https://www.youtube.com/watch?time_continue=52&v=D65-9sz7V0g)

The mind-blowing realization is that, if your conscious mind
understands how the sociophysical ensemble corresponds to intuition
and, if you are skilled resolving synchronicity, then you can develop
the skill of consciously emulating intuition. It's a metacognitive
skill with profound implications. Since it tells you the most valuable
places to look for relevant information, *it tells you everything you
need to know ... that you don't already know.*

When the sense or functionality of intuition is itself under a
person's control, it basically makes them a quasi-psychic. Still, it
requires proactive & reactive engagement. Otherwise, you can be duped
into delusional thinking by this "emulated" intuition, just as you can
be duped by your subconscious intuition. You have to form hypotheses
-- and then act on them. In my life, information flows one way: away
from me. It never flows to me. People short-circuit my access to
information while encouraging beliefs they know to be false. I'm not
sure if this is the **most unhealthy thing you can do** for "someone
you fear may be delusional" -- but it's probably pretty close.

Essentially, there are many ideas of Jüng that were unprovable by
existing experimental methodologies for which data science and
neurology will close in on and prove unquestionably. This should
happen within the next 10 years. Some of his ideas, may not have a
neuro-analytical basis -- but just because you can't prove it's true
doesn't mean it is not true.

Even if there's no rationale for connecting your detection of
synchronicity to some person's intention in your social environment,
reasoning about it helps you metacognitively reflect on your self. Why
did that event seem synchronous? Is it just me? Can I discern when
someone intends to provoke synchronicity? Why would they try so hard?
That last question is usually a good check on paranoid thinking -- how
would someone have access to information that informs them on how to
provoke synchronicity? You must be able to reason about social flows
of information to reason about this. In isolation and under
surveillance, the weaponization of synchronicity can drive someone
insane -- EASILY! This is how the mafia threatens you, by the
way. They use the idea of the Kantian Category along with provocation
of synchronicity to send the signal: BACK OFF! ... from what? If i
don't know, i can't heed your threat. It's meaningless.

There is a brilliant theorum of holes in space called
[Gauss-Bonnet](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gauss–Bonnet_theorem). Just
like Gauss's [Theorema
Egregium](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Theorema_Egregium) correlates
restrictions on the space of functions to elicit guarantees of
curvature, the theorum of Gauss-Bonnet places elicits similar
constraints for how the Euler Characteristic must behave, given the
curvature of space or of surfaces. There is equilibrium in all
curvature: this is what the Theorema Egregia tells us. Wherever there
is an increase, if continuity constraints are to be maintained, there
must be corresponding decrease. However, in the study of algebraic
topology, Gauss-Bonnet is similar, but applies to the manisfestation
of holes in n-dimensional shapes. This theorum correlates changes in
Euler Characteristic to necessitate compensating chagnes in the
surface curvature to the need to average the values of Euler
Characteristic when considering the surfaces of manifolds,
differentially.

- maxima/minima along the hyperplane (which is like a higher-order
  cost function of theta-weight configurations of the cost function)
  in high-dimensional spaces yield regions that are inaccessible to
  any configuration of theta-weights.  these regions are, to the
  hyperplane, what white-holes are to black holes. this is why there
  are major topological connections to be found in optimizing the
  hyperparameters for machine learning.

Even the volume of spacetime *is* a surface: a 3D surface in a 4D
volume. This is perhaps more correctly considered as [2,1]-D surfaces
in a [3,1]-D volume, three dimensions of space and one of time. This
is why Gauss-Bonnet is relevent to cosmology and astronomy: the
singularities of black holes are the "holes" in spacetime and
therefore, Gauss-Bonnet applies to astronomy. Considering the
energetic consequences of the topology of spacetime -- as the surfaces
of its manifold changes topologically when hole appears where none was
before -- is fascinating. Why?  *Because equilibrium is a very special
thing.* For continuity constraints to be placed upon physical systems,
the additional constraint of energetic equilibrium results in a far
more limited space for potential system configurations.


The hyperplane describes an analytic algorithm's solution space -- the
range of possibilities for theta weights concerning the efficiency of
the algorithm. As algorithm training and backpropagation inform
gradient descent -- whether using Newton's method, one based on the
Fisher metric or another optimization method -- it generates a path on
the hyperplane surface. Gradually, the velocity of this object
traveling in the hyperspace slows down as the algorithm approaches
diminishing returns. Brouwer's translation theorem may apply to some
advanced optimization approaches, but Gauss-Bonnet certainly applies
when there are complicated topological features. This latter method is
related to the MAPPER algorithm, which converts the hyperplane into
simplicial complices which discretize the hyperplane's topological
features, to further efficient approximations about where returns are
less diminishing. MAPPER also enables XAI (explainable artificial
intelligence), since hyperplane features are imprints of form
corresponding to the problem domain. This is why reasoning about the
topological features of the hyperplane corresponds to metacognition.

No matter how one structures a computer vision algorithm, there are
image classes that trouble it. Since its score is always below 100%
accuracy, the configurations of theta-weights cluster around holes in
the hyperplane.  These may be whiteholes. Or, they may not be
singularities, but instead an insurmountable boundary to the
algorithm's hyperparameters. If the latter is true, the
hyperparameters must be tuned to cross into a region of the hyperplane
that corresponds to an inaccessible signed vector field or some
otherwise inaccessible region -- both are why Brouwer's is
relevant. It's like being stuck in a valley or canyon, never being
able to see what's beyond the horizon. Because you can't climb on the
ridges fast enough to get to the top to see, you never think to look
beyond. In 3-D? Easy. In n-D? The curse of dimensionality convolutes
the species of concavity and convexity which means there are lots of
pockets of space in the hyperplane to search -- none of which are
guaranteed to produce results.

Making inferences about Gauss-Bonnet allows the hyper-algorithm to
*analytically* reason about topological features in a manner
completely disconnected from the possible range of correspondent
domain features. By indirectly inferring their presence, the nature of
convexity beyond the ridgeline and whether the topological features
are singular, one overcome the barriers presented by hyperparameter
configuration. Hence, the Euler characteristic is relevant, and
Gauss-Bonnet tells you about how these "holes" are balanced and
distributed across the space, what their density is, how the
hyper-algorithm's conception of the hyperplane evolves, what the what
the implications are for hyperplane's curvature, etc. It's a metric
similar to the Laplacian or the Hausdorff dimension which changes over
the regions of the space considered.

The downside? This hyper-algorithmic process is expensive!
Topologically analyzing the hyperplane effectively involves a
cost-function of cost-function configurations. It is also a
particularly expensive application of metalearning, requiring perhaps
thousands of algorithm-trainings. In practice, applications require
analyzing the Hyperplane as it changes -- analyzing the changing
hyperplane diffeomorphically, in other words. When it changes,
*sometimes* previously held data, theta-paths and the assumptions
thereof must be thrown out.

### [Wherefore A Rough Diamond Lies Herein](#wherefore-a-rough-diamond-lies-herein)

As promised, there *is* genius in this ramble; here's the diamond in
the rough.

Just like there are applications of Gauss-Bonnet to spacetime, quantum
gravity, and even in energetic measures of [Simplicial
Complices](https://arxiv.org/abs/1703.06549) in the work of [Oliver
Knill](https://arxiv.org/search/?searchtype=author&query=Knill%2C+O),
it has applications in considering analytic hyperplanes
topologically. If it hasn't already, [Algebraic
Topology](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Algebraic_topology) can
revolutionize how an analytic hyperplane is considered for clustering
algorithms. If it's computationally feasible, topologically analyzing
the hyperplane for cluster classification. Identifying a cluster's
"center of mass" and dilineating the distance of cluster members
"inverts" the hyperplane and provides a field, upon which one can
apply the familiar operators of gradiant and Laplacian. However, this
space has topological features in it's various n-dimensional surfaces
and volumes. Therefore, Gauss-Bonnet is not simply applicable, but
should also augment existing means for balancing the arrangement of
clusters and determining the optimal hyper-parameters for training the
clustering algorithm.

Ultimately, pure math remains mental masturbation until an application
becomes relevant. Fortunately, an analytic interpretation of the I
Ching is implicitly dependent on natural philosophy and on metaphors
to natural phenomena. There is no purely abstract math.

### [Hexagram 1 and 2: Of Analytical Machines and Perfraction of Metaphysical Form](#hexagram-1-and-2-of-analytical-machines-and-perfraction-of-metaphysical-form)

Our minds are like vessels, entities of Receptive to complement the
Creative. In the language of the I Ching, to say the mind is a sponge
conveys its relationship to the Receptive, but they are all tuned to
different wavelengths and bands of information forms from the same
source: the Creative. These eternal forms exist independently from
time & space and thus the forms of the creative must manifest
themselves into the Receptive and every mind is a vessel, an
analytic-machine that has its own conception of these eternal
forms.

In the language of machine learning, an AI program's memory resources
form much the same function as a vessel. For computer vision, for
handwritten digits, here it is often seen that no domain logic -- no
explicit encoding of knowledge related to the domain -- is necessary
to achieve accuracy, per se. Yet, such domain logic in many cases can
augment the capabilities of those programs -- thus understanding the
nature of the creative and the eternal can similarly augment the human
mind. Regardless, the forms encoded within the training data begin to
manifest in the trained theta weights of the algorithm.

Almost every machine learning is a combinatoric analytical model of
some sort or another. It's the combinatorial use of polynomials that
correspond to some tensorial algebra -- i.e. some model made of matrix
multiplication. It's a lot simpler than it sounds. Here, the
analytical model converges to internalize a numerical model. Often, in
computation for physical or chemical simulations, it's found that the
most comprehensively numerical model is insufferably complicated, but
that another analytical or numerical model exists which achieves
effective accuracy for the simulation. What this means is that there
is some formula which is disconnected from the underlying physical
mechanics which can simplify computation without a loss of
accuracy.

#### Predicting the Average Size of Bubble[^average-bubble-size]

Predicting the average size of bubbles, or a distribution of
bubble sizes, in a foam like that produced by urine can be predicted
given a much simpler set of variables: pH, kinetic energy input,
surface tension, chemical properties solutes. To predict this, you use
a simplified analytical/numerical model, but complete accuracy cannot
be guaranteed.

#### The Wave Based Method (WPM)[^wave-based-method]

This method allows you to run fast simulations to predict the sound
that the shape of a drum might produce. If you understand what's
written in this article, you should understand a generalized
conception of a Wave Function, useful in the quantum information
theory that is detached from quantum mechanics. It is the former that
gives rise to the latter: information itself is primary and its
impacts on material is dependent on the nature of information.

Understanding this and also mathematical physics sheds light on the
nature of action the Creative exerts on and through the Receptive.
The combined numerical/analytical approaches to the problems above are
examples of approaching a problem, given the domain knowledge
extracted from experimentation. The approaches are *numerical* in
terms of physics, but are composed of analytical structures required
for discretization of vector fields in PDE's, particularly for the
Wave Based Method.[^wave-based-method-2]

Representational learning allows machine learning algorithms to begin
to disentangle its own impure conceptions of form. Eventually AI will
be able to deconstruct typological and metatypological relationships,
connecting these to semiotic, semantic and symbolic interpretations of
the meaning behind the relationships.

There are materially dependent metaphysical forms, but there are also
metaphysical forms which do not descend from the material plane at
all. Everything in the material plane is a consequence of these
eternal forms and can be more clearly seen through them. Since our
minds do arise in the material plane, whether one has a clear
conception of these eternal forms is another question
entirely. Further confounding the contention whether knowledge and
information is materially derived,

- are these alien-forms from outside our universe


### [Hexagram 13 is About Group Cohesion in Response to Local Minima, Not Simply "Fellowship with Men"](#hexagram-13-is-about-group-cohesion-in-response-to-local-minima-not-simply-fellowship-with-men)

Hexagram 13 ends (and begins) with an allusion to the space of the
meadow. This is a flat space, where motion in any direction is
easy. But in life, we must not simply accept comfort, per se, for if
we do, the powerful will count upon our complacency. Soon, we will
find our lives at the intersection of disproportionate influences.
However, crossing the great water is a trek across many hills and
valleys. If the crossing is a group endeavor, the hills and valleys of
that analytic hyperplane may disrupt the group by altering the
incentivization structure that motivates its individuals and
subgroups.

#### Hexagram 13: 3rd and 4th Lines

> *Nine in the third place means:*
>
> He hides weapons in the thicket;
>
> He climbs the high hill in front of it.
>
> For three years he does not rise up.
>
> *Nine in the fourth place means:*
>
> He climbs up on his wall; he cannot attack.
>
> Good fortune.

The meaning behind the third and fourth lines is that, to avoid
insurrection from within the group and to protect the cohesion of the
group, one must foresee how the shape of the space through which the
group might travel impacts the incentives of the group's members. If
the leaders of the group do so, then any planned insurrection where
the group factionalizes and "hide weapons in the thicket" then instead
become useful examples to the rest of the group, sacrificed towards
the need for group cohesion. Optimally, the leaders of the group
foresee this and avoid it entirely: thus, when the faction climbs up
on the wall, that faction finds that they cannot attack or insurrect
without adversely impacting their own motivations. Thereby, the group
remains as one.

### [Hexagram 15 Details The Phenomena of Normification, Not Simply "Modesty"](#hexagram-15-details-the-phenomena-of-normification-not-simply-modesty)

What is modesty? In social interactions? How does one know how to
subtle tailor the presentation of action and intent to match a modest
display of values? This is accomplished by averaging qualities of
one's life experience and comparing them against society's average
expectations.

The lines of Hexagram 15, Modesty, detail phenomena, dynamics and
mechanics of norms and normification. Paradoxes arise in norms: how
does one project their beliefs and values regarding some subject when
there aren't enough data regarding that subject for society to have
formed norms and expectations?

#### Hexagram 15: 1st and 2nd Lines

> *Nine at the beginning means:*
>
> A superior man modest about his modesty
>
> May cross the great water.
>
> Good Fortune.
>
> *Six in the second place means:*
>
> Modesty that comes to expression.
>
> Perseverence brings good fortune.

In the first and second lines of Hexagram 15: before the first, no
norm existed, but after such an undertaking as the crossing of the
great water ....

- move content about normification here.

# The Statistical Mechanics of I Ching

- How does the Yarrow Sticks method of sampling critically differ from
  a Tarot deck? partly because the sampling process is not a
  differential: i.e. the probabilities of the next sampled reading do
  not depend on the state of the deck of cards. Why do Vegas dealers
  *only* draw from fresh decks of cards? For similar reasons: to
  eliminate any potential differential interdependency in the values
  sampled. So, the yarrow sticks method is like sampling from a fresh
  deck of cards every time.
