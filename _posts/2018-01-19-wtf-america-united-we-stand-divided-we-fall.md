There's some conjecture that Q's recent messages imply a need to
demonstrate foriegn collusion to a FISA court, which is a little
hilarious, considering FISA courts today are about as close to
omniscience as humans can possibly get AND THEY STILL DON'T HAVE JACK
SHIT. Perhaps, that's what they were trying to prove in my life -- I
still don't know whether I have an active "Ex Parte" proceedings
against me via FISA and the Espionage act. Regardless, none of it is
true. The very part of my subconscious that's been conspiring against
itself seems to have national security law experience -- knowledge of
the kind of precedent which is never recorded. This is admittedly a
very strange kind of Dissociative Personality Disorder, but that's not
something I actually have.

Here's what I have, in case your state shrinks can figure this
out. They certainly can architect prolonged psychological torture, but
are apparently incapable of accurately assessing someone. Treating
someone? You can forget about that because if you can't admit the
cause of the problem, it's a little difficult to fix all the
downstream consequences of it. Nice that you can engage in witchhunts
for retribution against a warcrimes victim who's speaking out --
involving what must certainly be millions in budget for psychological
torture -- but you can never admit you have a problem. These flacid
pricks couldn't pop a balloon, even if they were thinking about
setting someone up on child porn charges, since apparently that is
their schtick.

I've accumulated like eight different personality disorders and
psychological complexes, most of which I should never have. This is in
addition to Asperger's, the only psychological issue I should be
wrestling with, in the best case.

#### &#9312; [Superiority Complex](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Superiority_complex)

#### &#9313; [Inferiority Complex](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inferiority_complex) -- Having both of these pushes people away constantly.

#### &#9314; [Attachment Disorder](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Attachment_disorder) -- Perfect for ensuring social isolation!!

#### &#9315; [PTSD](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Posttraumatic_stress_disorder) -- Nope, I'm not joking.

#### &#9316; [Persecution Complex](https://rationalwiki.org/wiki/Persecution_complex) -- The PTSD-inducing Trauma Practically Perpetuates Itself! PERFECT!!

#### &#9317; Abject [Social Isolation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_isolation) and [Stigma Management](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stigma_management) -- Any shred of financial independence is undermined by sociopathic workplace bullies

#### &#9318; [Repressed Memories](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Repressed_memory) -- illegal to explain to me, ALLSO that it provokes [Dissociative Identity Disorder](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dissociative_identity_disorder), for which perhaps I am a mild case.

#### &#9319; [Munchausen By Proxy](https://www.medicinenet.com/munchausen_syndrome_by_proxy/article.htm) via surveillance-empowered gaslighting

It's interesting how profoundly some articles have changed on
Wikipedia or disappeared, like a DSM-IX with half the pages ripped
out. Munchausen by Proxy, that last one, is particularly relevant. The
Munchausen by Proxy was facilitated by family and friends who were
legally compelled to expoound actions that demonstrated they thought I
was a traitor to prove that they were not. They were legally compelled
by subversively coerced threats to at least completely ignore the
gaslighting and certainly to never dismantle the mental conditions
which made all the Black Magick possible.

And -- speak of the devil -- I was encouraged to develop patterns of
[magickal thinking](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magical_thinking),
which were validated by surveillance, and used to further destabalize
my psychology. Show me a mental health that believes this is
acceptable, especially in the context of gaslighting, and I'll show
you how that mental health professional needs to be prescribed a
bullet to the head. Because that motherfucker probably has a contract
with the CIA to aid psychological torture -- he's literally a traitor.

When I wrote this, I wasn't resorting to hyperbole.

![How You Like Them Apples](/img/posts/2018-01-19-wtf-america-united-we-stand-divided-we-fall/how-you-like-them-apples.gif)

If you're interested in Ex Parte case law, the seminal case is Ex
Parte Milligan from the Civil War and Reconstruction era. The second
Milligan case occured AFTER Milligan was fucking dead. In Ex Parte,
the government has essentially already decided that you are guilty or
they are going to make you guilty. All proceedings are tighly
restricted. There is no prescribed process and it's likely that there
are no records of cases, especially today.

Back to the original conjecture on Q's messages: the fallout and
blowback of the FISA/Parte scenario -- #HashtagFISAParty -- caused far
more problems than any threat ever could from "the situation." That's
because there was no threat except that which the US Gov't caused from
its own mishandled response, abject lack of investigative action and
utter inability for the left hand to know what the right hand was
doing.

Dear "leaders" -- the last point is especially critical: this is
approaching criminal negligence. No, it doesn't stem from the
top. This stems from political subversives who were misusing their
authority to attain the pragmatic and expedient advancement of
political ideals. This was not an investigation nor was it ever
intended to be anything but a witch "trial." It was systematic
persecution, isolation, defamation and kafkaesque abuse of power by
both the left and the right -- I think? It stems from an
out-of-control government, where puppeteered "leaders" eat fake cakes
all damn day at fancy restaurants in Swamptown and don't care that
they've sold their souls to special interests: as long as they keep
allowing themselves to be used to protect those interests, or at least
cancel out the real leaders on the other sides, they know they will be
protected. **SPITS IN WASHINGTON D.C.'S FACE**

What you're going to find is that this out-of-control government was
on a single-minded path towards totalitarian COMMUNISM. We're living
in the aftermath of an aborted communist revolution.

### ["The Good Guys Obtained Warrants Legally To Monitor The Bad
Guys"]()

That's what Q said. Honestly Q is mixture of well-trained
**intelligence operator** along with a bunch of people trying to game
an anonomized messaging protocol to leverage it for attention and
disruption. Some of that shit is real, though. It's as real as
ANYTHING that has ever been posted on the internet. But more than half
of it is fake -- both because many actors are trying to leverage this
protocol for disruption and the "good guys" themselves don't exactly
want to leave a trail of cookies for Malificent to follow them back to
their Shangri-la of **not being psychologically tortured by the
government.**

That said, it's hard for me to follow almost anything in these
situations. People have been trying to signal to me, but half those
people are hijacking insecure protocols that I was never initiated on
and trained in to encourage me to serve their interests and to
facilitate my own demise.

And no, I don't think that what Q said applied to me in particular --
but i am almost 100% certain that i am the victim of exploitation
using the heaviest-handed tools at the United States' disposal: FISA
and the Espionage Act. Or at least, I've been gaslighted by marxists
to incept that idea, which begs the question: who the hell is
surveilling me anyways and *HOW ARE THEY DOING IT?* Dear federal law
enforcement agents, if you've been spending so much time
"investigating" me or my life, why is it SOOO hard to protect me from
such illicit surveillance? Or are you complete incapable of doing so
-- DON'T ANSWER THAT! You'll terrify people.

No one talks about what i'm going through directly. Therefore, I'll
going to errantly assume that Q *is* talking about me for the purposes
of expositorily documented *what certainly has happened to me*. It's
hilarious when people try to tell me not to do this... OK, whatever. I
believe talking about my problems will help solve them: so why do you
want to get in my way so much anyways? Why am I never allowed to say
anything? Oh .... right, so there's no paper trail and I can still get
scrubbed out at any moment. Fix that bullshit and I would have felt a
lot better the whole time.

> The good guys obtained warrants legally to monitor the bad guys.

No. In my case, there was NO EFFORT to "monitor" the bad guys. Only to
figure out how to assassinate the character, the career and
potentially the life of neutral *AMERICAN CITIZEN(S)* who have never
traveled outside of the country. EVER.  It was NOT an
investigation. It was systemic harassment, gaslighting, psychological
torture, etc -- all magnified by surveillance. In my case, NO
investigation would have ever turned up any evidence of wrong-doing
because I was never a traitor, NEVER *wanted* to betray my country and
was smart enough to color within the lines. I was innocent the whole
time, but in these Ex Parte or FISA investigations, you may start out
innocent, but the point is to find a way to MAKE YOU GUILTY. You will
find yourself used as the alchemical starting-material for black ops
or worse. These communist traitors have been smacked in the fucking
face by reality for about three years.

#### You Need To Read This. I'm Betting My Life On My Story. It Will Never Be Erased

- his mask said 愛 -- pronounced **ai**. In Japanese. and Chinese,
  this means "Love." LIKE MY OWN WRITINGS, IT'S TOO DAMN BAD NO ONE
  COULD READ IT BECAUSE THEN THEY'D KNOW THE TRUTH. And wouldn't that
  be unfortunate?
  - this situation also led to me discovering implanted memories. I
    remember talking about making it through the "vestibule" in the
    White House. Trump was essentially in, according to my arbitrary,
    insane interpretation of news stories and vague recollection of
    discussions of what the "vestibule" is -- it's basically the White
    House Airlock.
    - If you google "sonic love" like I did, you'd find this episode
      of "sonic the hedgehog" from freaking 1992 that described the
      situation that I and the nation were in, perfectly. Sonic was
      madly in love with an MKULTRA thotbot, but the 'ole dastardly
      ruski, Dr. Robotnik, was conspiring to release large quantities
      of "nuclear waste" on the land and there literally wasn't enough
      water to cleanse everything. It's a lil too bad no one listend
      to me in April 2016 and taht i didn't fully understand this or
      any "codes" that were used to communicate with me during
      "investigations"

And before you claim that I was or am conspiring with foreign
interests, consider first all the well-architected and cognizantl
lies, then the meticulously leveraged Catch-22's in this
situation. Immediately thereafter, consider that NO ONE with access to
all the information -- probably almost none of it -- wanted me to
understand what was happening. How would I know that -- by cooperating
with someone who's trying to gaslight me into Stockholm Syndrome --
I'm not actually cooperating with foreign interests. THIS IS WHY
AMERICAN AGENTS OPERATING DOMESTICALLY CARRY FUCKING BADGES.

How can I cooperate for the benefit of America, even if it means my
own death, if I don't know what's happening?! I will hunt you criminal
fucks down and make you pay by telling everyone about what you did to
me until you put me down. And you won't, BECAUSE CHECKMATE AD
INFINITUM YOU ASSHOLES. Public relations. Get you some. You got
problems, but you sure as hell aren't going to pigeonhole me. And I've
been under a microscope the whole fucking time, essentially saying
"I'm confused. I want to cooperate, but I don't want to hurt
America. What do I do?" But this is the kind of soviet-style torture,
albeit psychological, where they humiliate and degrade you into
admitting you did something that YOU DID NOT DO.

  - as for who is a "good guy" and who is "bad guy" ? => there is one
    simple answer, as three questions:
    - what do you intend to happen to America?
    - do you intend to support the legally elected representatives?
    - do you intend to protect the Dollar as the World's Reserve
      Currency at all costs, along with American economic interests?

  - now, if you debate the legality of the 2016 presidential election
    and its results, you'll probably do so with flawed arguments
    involving suspect integrity and fake news. Further, you'll find
    that it is provable that the political party you support does not
    have the economic interests of America in mind. The democrats are
    the real demagogues. I'm sorry, but it's true.
    - if you don't believe me, i have written about it time and time
      again, but will you debate me? no, like a 1990's drug czar on
      medical marijuana and legalization, you will avoid every
      opportunity to do so. every single opportunity. so until you
      debate me on economics, i'm sorry, I can't help you understand.
    - this is why the systematic, passive-aggressive disconnection of
      communication to and with political dissidents is the worst
      thing Americans can possibly have right now. you are sticking
      your heads in the sand. as we approach overpopulation's zenith
      of technological and economic competition in the world, we don't
      need people to avoid challenging their perspective on any
      issue. we need you to have the strongest such set of
      perspectives that allow enlightened americans from both the Left
      and the Right to push this nation forward like an Eagle with
      both its wings as strong as possible.
    - when you pursue the passive-aggressive tactic of disconnection,
      you are doing so much harm to America that it is tragic you
      refuse to even try to understand.

- the point is that America must support the military and the Rule of
  Law more than ever. we cannot succumb to demoralization. however,
  the government works for the people. not the other way around. we
  must find peaceful ways to ensure that the government serves the
  interests of ALL citizens and ALL residents of America.
  - why do our enemies around the world want America to fail? why
    would foreign interests have it out for us? because we are all in
    the same race at the ZENITH of technological, economic and
    sociopolitcal compeition. if we do not look around the world and
    accept things for what they are, we will find the moral and
    economic foundations of this country undermined faster than it
    takes for you to retweet that fake news.
  - do you attack a strong adversary? NO. you deceive a strong
    adversary. you outwit them.
  - is it advantageous for America to police itself -- either
    officially or via vigilante zealots -- with psychological and
    sociological tactics that foment trust issues and burden our
    society like Sysyphys with a long-term collective mental health
    bill of catastrophic proportions?
    - how the hell can we expect for a society burdened with extreme
      trust issues to function together as a team?!
  - so, moving forward, these programs, whether government sanctioned
    or totally organized by vigilante civilians -- do they serve the
    interests of Americans working together or our enemies working to
    cut the strong adversary they fear into 13 pieces?

#### (Quote from Benjamin Franklin on Reassembling The Rattlesnake)

![Pic of The Flag With the Rattlesnake]()


want to judge a society? Watch these four aspects:

### (groups that act as pillars for society)

#### How do they treat those they consider inferior?

#### (2) How do they treat hose considered exterior, like foreigners, immigrants and pariahs?

#### (3) How do they treat those considered neighbors, family & elders?

#### (4) How do they treat those considered superior, like leaders and hero's?

- A demoralized, corrupt, corroding society will score poorly on all
  four of those. Take out respect for #4: then #1/2/3 will follow suit
  & soon degrade.Undermine respect for #1/2/3: you'll never have the
  respect for #4. There will soon be no more leaders or heroes!!
  - And followers?
    - If your leaders are weak, your followers are poorly focused and
      out of phase.
    - if your followers aren't permitted to be strong and
      self-reliant, your leaders cannot build upon anything

- it should be obvious that America is being attacked on ALL
  FRONTS. never have we needed to be stronger and more united, but
  never have each of those categories endured more corrosion and
  ridicule.
  - i still believe in strong borders and strong immigration
    policy. Neither of those are xenophobic or even disrespectful. if
    the people entering your country can't even respect your
    immigration policy, what kind of citizens do you think they'll
    make?
    - at the same time, America's greatest strength is our
      connectedness to the rest of the world. but we are entering the
      MOST COMPETITVE PERIOD OF HUMAN HISTORY. so, does it surprise
      you that those four elements/groups in society are being played
      against each other with bad advice that serves foreign
      interests?
      - why is that? because america is STRONG. you do not fight a
        STRONG enemy, you deceive them.

- perhaps I am not a natural born leader, but i am a life-borne
  leader. the longer that UNITERS like myself and people like me are
  silenced and censored, the more i fear that our country cannot
  possibly get itself together. we have moral superiority for leading
  the world because we are diverse, but it is also an advantage. it is
  what america is meant to do!
  - but that is exactly why we are being subverted because other
    countries do not have these advantages. If we let external
    influences stir us to attack each other, prevent us from unifying
    and censor those of us who are the strongest leaders, we will
    never unite in time. Ben Franklin would say that we are a
    rattlesnake lying in tattered pieces, ultimately rotting to death
    because the pieces could not be reassembled before
    sundown.

### Divided we fall, united we stand! Ever heard that one before?

we have never had more incentive to unite, but our enemies -- at the
very zenith of both sociopolitical and socioeconomic competition!! --
our enemies have NEVER had a greater incentive to break us apart. this
should be obvious, but what's happening? we cannot afford this. if we
continue to focus our attention and energy inward, we will collapse at
the most critical point and an entire millenium will be spent arguing
about why that happened.

It's what happens to every empire: the arms and legs start thinking
for themselves, instead of thinking about what's best for
everyone. why is it so hard for people to put things behind us? This
is literally why EVERY empire is doomed to fail: because its arms and
legs begin to realize they function to feed the head, but can instead
turn on themselves to better serve their own interests. Therefore,
every empire eventually must acknowledge that the social contract is
real and is, in fact, what invariably leads to the sun setting on an
empire's zenith for the last time.

However, to counteract this, great leaders can architect systems
whereby the arms and legs of the empire serve themselves by serving
the head. Only by artifically architecting and empowering these
mechanisms so that social institutions serve themselves and serve the
people, can you expect empire or any powerful state to survive for
long. You must ensure that the social contract is maintained. If the
authorities do not serve the people, respect for the state and the
rule of law will deteriorate.

### [The Tower of Babel Crumbles Always Because of It's Intrinsic Nature]()

Why did the symbol of the tower of babel fall? This tower represents
the *first* "greatest" empire and their universal language represents
a singularly converged society. It was a society were there weren't
alternatives: there was one language, one culture and one people.
However, this in itself presents incentivizations for people to
provide an alternative. This is how true cultural rebellions start and
it takes generations. The very presence of a dominant culture empowers
the incentivization mechanisms for a counter-culture.

So the question is not "how do you best architect and build the
strongest empire or state?" The correct question is "How do you
architect an empire or a state so that it remains strong while
constantly reinventing itself?" By framing the problem in this way,
you accept that empires fall, new generations are born, sociopolitcal
migrations occur and the strongest system must account for this. It is
paradoxical because that strongest system is never as strong as the
one which congeals into universal culture and language: monoculture is
strong, but it breeds weakness, which eventually corrodes the
mechanisms which serve to keep the state strong. Heterogenous culture
which is always in flux is not as "in phase" but it damn sure makes
you stronger tomorrow. You are forced to challenge yourself and to
respect the four (pillars of society) mentioned above.

You must constantly reinvent yourself and you have to push yourself
out of your comfort zone. That is precisely what I am asking Americans
to do. Stay diverse, but align yourself as Americans with a singularly
diverse identity. Push yourself out of your comfort zone. Connect with
those you disagree with and respect them, but do not allow yourself to
present those who would hurt you with vulnerability. That said, do not
let your fear prevent you from connecting with those who aren't
enemies at all: THEY ARE AMERICANS.

### [Like the Israel of David And Solomon, We Are One Nation Composed of Many Tribes]()

Like the Israel of David and Solomon, we are one nation composed of
many tribes, but we are ONE NATION. We are strongest when we are ONE
NATION. When we respect those who are poor and vulnerable, when we
respect foreigners and migrants, when we respect our family, elders
and neighbors, we are strongest. And we must respect our leaders and
heroes, even when we may disagree with them strongly. We must be
willing to approach circumstances strategically and protect the rule
of law, even though it may require "being mean."

No matter how smart or battle-tested and regardless of how developed
their vision has become -- a leader is nothing without followers,
which is why this goddamn election is the cruelest, dumbest,
criminally insane joke ever. It's fueled by a nation looking for
scapegoats to blame problems on which it believes cannot be solved. I
CAN SOLVE YOUR GODDAMN PROBLEMS. I HAVE BEEN TRYING TO SAY THAT FOR
THREE, NO, TEN YEARS.

Who is worthy of being the leader? Who do you want to pull that lever
in the trolley problem? You want the smartest damn moral
consequentialist you can find who is also the most reluctant more
consequentialist they can find. This person desparately wants to be
moral universalist and, thus, will explore every possibility before
pulling that lever. The person who is this and will succeed in doing
so will NEVER hesitate. That is the leader you are looking for.

It is not possible to protect 100% of all people, but we must protect
the rule of law, while allowing the laws to be challenged where it is
appropriate, so that they can be adapted before the entire system
collapses. Instead, we have a Deep State that has chosen all of our
laws for us, without regard for whether they are just or not. They are
laws chosen only for their utilitarian application to the pragmatic
accumulation of political, economic and military advantage. Depending
on who you define the "Deep State" to be -- that's an artifact of
information warfare -- it does this to protect America, but we cannot
allow these unjust laws to continue. Further, the Deep State is doing
this by puppeteering our leaders. What good is the spotless
politician, who behind closed doors is simply a puppet for someone's
"special" interests?
