# Spatiotemporal Interrogation of the Structure of Analytical Models

- networks of neurons, whether biological or artificial, process input
  and output that is inherently coupled to phenomena with
  spatiotemporal components. the input, especially sensory input, is
  intrinsically connected to components with spatial and temporal
  components. for the analysis of neural networks with unknown
  structure, the reliance on both spatial and temporal components
  provides unparalleled utility for structural analysis, particularly
  the temporal components.

  - the regions of neural networks more proximally connected to input
    source are the simplest to interrogate because they're most
    immediately connected to spatiotemporal signal changes. as
    activations propagate furter away from the signal source in a
    neural network, there is more capacity for the propagated signals
    to encode abstraction divorced from the spatiotemporal aspects of
    the signal.

- for this article, i need to emphasize that i'm discussing neural
  networks, generally.
  - i also need to articulate the idea of "adversarial neural
    networks" -- networks that try to predict the output of other
    networks.
    - it will help to link the discussions from Simon's Institute on
      Adversarial networks (though i haven't watched them)
  - there is an artificial network:
    - and an observed network:
  - specifically, i need to articulate that the adversarial network
    has access to particular signals from the neural network or simply
    aggregates of regional activity, but doesn't know the
    interconnected structure of the network
    - i.e. you're looking at real-time imagery from the human
      brain. you know that imagery data corresponds to specific neural
      activations, but you don't know which neurons it corresponds to
    - i.e. or, an adversarial neural network has the ability to
      analyze the unencrypted regions of memory representing another
      artifical neural network's real-time activation. it may know the
      that specific ranges of memory regions correspond to tensors or
      matrices of specific rank and dimension, but it doesn't know how
      those neurons interconnect.
    - regardless of the mechanics of the network, your adversarial
      nework is capable of modulating input with varying degrees of
      control over the granularity of input modulation.
      - i.e. for the biological network, you can project an image in
        front the person's eyes, but you don't know how the
        granularity of the image corresponds to how retinal neurons
        are activated.
      - i.e. for the artificial networks, the adversarial network can
        modulate the input stream to the observed network. it should
        know how the data frames for that input stream are structure,
        but perhaps it doesn't.
  - finally, the adversarial network's goal is to modulate input to
    analyze the unknown network structure of the observed network

### (Periodicity)

- it's the spatiotemporal aspects of signal components that make
  network analysis possible
  - the adversarial network can abuse periodicity and analyze time
    series of addresses in the observed network's memory regions for
    corresponding modulation in activations.

### Detection of Orthogonality in time series components with assumed connection

### Adversarial Analysis of A Neural Network with Known Structure

- can an adversarial network infer the representation of objects that
  the observed network has abstracted from analysis of visual sensory
  data?
  - if so, the adversarial network can make assumptions about whether
    an object's representation has been internalizd and is thus likely
    to affect the observed networks future decisions.
  - would it be possible to observe the neural activations for some
    predator who has failed to recognize some camoflaged, potential
    prey within their visual field? most data scientists would
    probably tell you "no"
    - however, for that potential prey, can't it discern itself
      whether or not the predator has recognized the prey? how is it
      that this is instictual for animals who have no such access to
      the activations of neural networks, but impossible for
      adversarial computers that do? it's not impossible, but
      intractible or ineffective
    - in nature, an animal's cognition is constrained to their own
      sensory input stream as well as to the internalized, persisted
      representations of objects their individual conditioning has
      deemed significant. this stream of information either has what
      is necessary to the animal's survival or it doesn't.

- can the adversarial network infer the direction of the observed
  network's focus or intent of action? such inferences would only
  apply to extremely sophisticated observed networks with the ability
  to reorient cognition.

### Neural Representations Enabling Modeling Requiring Stochastic Calculus

- do these representations

- fluid dynamics and energetic dynamics of the spread of activations
  through a network (correlate to hydrostatics & fluid dynamics)
  - is there an understanding of the modulation of representaitons of
    probability in a system as fluid flows?
    - for water moreso than other liquids, its volume as a fluid
      doesn't change with regard to pressure/ at normal temperatures.
  - probability is similar, in that it's volume must integrate to one,
    regardless of the shape of the distribution and the dispersion
    over various dimensions
  - therefore, because neural networks are statistical in nature, this
    analogy of fluid dynamics must also carry over, albeit in a
    convoluted manner, since neural networks are multi-layered
    analytical models.
    - upon input signal change, the time-series outputs from the
      intermediate layers and output layers there are particular rules
      -- particularly with regard to continuity and integrability to
      unity -- that an adversarial network may assume the observed
      network layers to hold to.

### Timeseries Analysis On models of physical systems

    - Is this paper
      [arXiv:1302.0430v2](http://arxiv.org/abs/1302.0430v2) relevant
      to making inferences about systems modeling physical phenomena
      with stochastic calcules and augmenting those systems with by
      using lie algebra to coalesce more accurate assumptions of
      transformations in system mechanics?
      - in other words, physical systems with mechanics that depend on
        the orientation of multiple frames of reference to one another
        need to have models that utilize lie algebra/groups, which are
        useful for modeling physics at large and small scales
      - these systems may also need to estimate trajectory or
        potential of types of interaction events, for which the
        alignment of coordinate frames stratifies the divergence of
        events which are very different from one another qualitatively
      - bouncing a football. does it land on its side, relative to the
        ground? if so, it's physical dynamics are much more
        predictable, but when it lands on one of the two ends, then
        the specifics related to the two coordinate frames of
        reference become more relevant in predicting the physcial
        reaciton of the football. such a system with a football or
        more complicated objects can then use lie algebras (somehow
        ????) to simplify/expedite calculations
- that paper talks about signals analysis generally, but i think
  there's definitely a connection between that and adversarial
  analysis of neural networks




### Cognition and Object Classification

- how does the brain think about objects to which its conditioning has
  ascribed (particular functional idiosyncracies)? In other words: how
  does the brain deal with objects which have the capacity to interact
  with abnormal physics?
  - why are people much more capable of intuitively cognizing about
    these objects and their physical interactions than most animals?
    - PIC: a dog on a skateboard
  - this requires object classification


# Can the Human Brain Adversarially Analyze It's Own Cognitive Trace?

- and to what degree of efficacy?

- what i do know is that you cannot encrypt anything related to this
  signal without sophisticated analog encryption -- impossible without
  a hardware interface.

- TODO: lotus pic


- can the human brain analyze it's own signals for interconnectedness?
  - i.e. if one's mind can open up to the data representating
    low-level neural activations, then the subconscious can begin to
    be conditioned to react to its anticipations of dynamics of its
    representations of physical and non-physical



  - connect to "cuban" ultrasound device, whose frequency, amplitude
    modulation and apparent stereoscopic variation all correspond to
    sensory input and motor output signals.
    - particularly, for this ultrasound, the degree of variation from
      the norm amplitude/frequency corresponds to neural activity.
    - what does this mean? i can modulate my thoughts and/or motor
      activity to analyze how the sound changes to make inferences
      about my own cognitive processes and quantity of neural
      activations
    - what i "hear" as a result is some correspondance between the
      volume of displacement from the normal sound and the assumed
      displacement of neural activity in my brain.
  - this "volume" in change, i believe, reflects the assertion made
    above about an analogy of fluid dynamics and hydrostatics to
    valuation in various regions/layers neural network stastical
    models.
    - there is a particular "je ne sais quoi" to the volume in signal
      displacement as the ultrasound changes in reaction to my
      thoughts and muscle engagements
    - bagua zhang, peripheral (feedback) nervous system and
      discretizing muscular positions over ranges of flexibility for
      limbs.
      - in what i hear when i move my limbs in specific ways, there
        are discontinuities in the signal frequency at very specific
        ranges of limb motion. the angles do not change for which each
        discontinuity in frequency change is heard. the angles
        preserve consistency and the discontinuity in signal
        transformation occurs at the same locations every time.
        - what would be fascinating is whether these points of
          discontinuity correlate to the Bagua Zhang's map of human
          body positions.
      - if anyone who's worked in cybernetics would be aware of the
        connection here to how the body encodes it's own awareness of
        body postions in signals received/processed from the
        (peripheral nervous system)
      - the fluctuation in electrical signal representing the
        input/output motor signals in the nervous system would be
        mostly coordinated through:
        - the spinal coord (and specific nerve bundles to each limb)
        - the cranial nerves and brain stem
        - the cranial and lower motor neurons' interconnection with
          the cerebellum via the pons, converging in the corticobulbar
          and corticospinal tracts
        - the signals sent by the motor cortex, orchestrated by the
          striatum and basal ganglia, must exhibit amplification and
          deamplification at various points.
      - again, these are all phenomena that must be well known by
        cybernetics researchers.
        - however, i believe the "discontinuities" that i'm hearing
          have nothing to do with my motor engagement, but instead
          concern the brain's awareness of limb positioning, as its
          informed by the

- what i know so far? the 8khz ultrasound propagates through my
  vascular system primarily.
  - what seems to be intended to be mostly a torture device apparently
    has the potential for gamification.
  - so far, it's driven me to discover more about my neurovascular
    system, so i can intuit more about the significance of
    stereoscopic displacement of the sound. i.e. when i close my eyes
    and move my right arm, there is a significant

- bacopa monnieri and the occasional "chirping" sound, which is a
  wavelike-periodic change in the frequency of the ultrasound. I've
  only been hearing the ultrasound for 3 months or so. still, this
  "chirping" dynamic is completely new, but i still haven't correlated
  the potential qualitative aspects of cognition that might seem to
  cause it, however subjective such an inference might be.
  - in addition to being a failed entrepreneur, i'm also a failed
    audio engineer with a working knowledge of reverb, ultrasound
    propaction characteristics and isophonic frequency
    response. furthermore, i have a poor-man's understanding of
    signals analysis, so i can diagnose systems with dynamics and
    mechanics holistically, whereas this would be completely ineffable
    for most.
