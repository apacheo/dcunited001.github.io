- TODO: figure out how to structure (with illustrations?) so that
  pretty much anyone can understand what i'm talking about

- body waves and liquid movement incidentally resemble many of the
  movements of Qi Gong. not only do they visually resemble the
  movements, but they functionally cause many of the same anatomical
  effects of Qi Gong and Yoga.
  - this may allow Poplocking to serve as a stand-in for the practice
    of Qi Gong or Yoga towards the cultivation of Chi or Prana,
    respectively

- if you seek true liberation and other people subsist by siphoning
  your sociophysical resources -- i.e. they take the value work they
  underpay you for, or they plan on deciving you to manipulate you to
  gain sociophysical influence -- then your liberation is expensive to
  their sociophysical potential energy.
  - your cage is not made of steel: there is no physical lock. you
    might spend your entire life looking for a physical key, but there
    is no key in the outside world. this is a fool's errand. the keys
    to your liberation come from within.
  - if you understood the structure of your own cage and freed
    yourself, they would no longer be able to use you. or they'd no
    longer be able to siphon quite as much energy from you. so, when
    this liberation happens on a social scale, it terrifies the
    parasites that completely subsist on the efforts of others.
    - not all people who occupy higher strata in social hierarchies
      qualify as parasites. it really depends on how much value they
      contribute to society and how much blood they suck. obviously,
      so hierarchy and structure in society is unavoidable; managers
      and people with authority are a necessary evil.
    - yet, quite a few high-ranking people in the high-classes subsist
      unfairly on value derived by those toiling below them. as for
      those people whose livelihoods depends not on hard-work but on
      precariously maintained deception, their lives are ironically
      less secure than that of the common person and the honest
      person.
      - their livelihoods depend on projecting deception -- they
        cannot continue to suck blood without continuing to deceive.
        the moment this illusion is shattered with significance and
        permanence, all those parasites in high places come tumbling
        down. from here on out, they must suffer with the karma of
        their deceptions that were made visible to everyone.
      - these people fear this. they know this. the object of their
        fear: the truth heard so loudly it can no longer be suppressed
        and forever preempts any illusions they'd seek to construct in
        its place.

- Hip Hop is about (waking people up and providing people in poverty
  with the tools to transform their lives), without needing to go
  outside of the community to seek permission for transformation.
  - Hip hop is a collection of cultural elements, whose practice
    cannot be denied to people on the basis that they don't have the
    money to participate.
  - In addition to these aspects of Poplocking, Hip hop also includes
    other means to subversively introduce spiritual practices to
    communities that are often isolated and repressed.
    - (True transformation that doesn't backslide avoids shortcuts and
      cannot depend on outside help that ultimately results in
      dependence and pre-existing obligations)
    - Hiphop provides a basis for bottom-up cultural
      transformation. People became empowered to change their own
      lives without needing to entangle people from the outside for
      assistance with social/financial resources. By leveraging
      art-styles created by the people themselves, they also created
      their own means of seeing themselves, measuring themselves and
      defining themseves. Therefore, by looking at themselves through
      the patterns of art they created themselves, they also became
      empowered to define their own self-worth.
      - Because it was all enabled without external social dependence
        and because the democratization of technology meant that these
        means of self-transformation were available to mostly
        everyone...
  - Graffiti is an artform about seizing the imagery in urban
    communities, transforming it into art that reflects the needs for:
    for positivity; for identity; and for control and ownership of
    cultural artifacts, even when the buildings in those communities
    can't be owned by impoverished people who live there.
  - Rap and MC was originally about telling stories that were not
    allowed to be broadcast on the airwaves and published in the
    paper.
    - Through their words, Def Jam poets and early MC's wanted to
      maintain a history of what people in communities repressed by
      poverty actually saw. Without the means to create, promote and
      share their own art, any cultural artifacts produced without the
      approval of the rich or the white lacked the kind of permanence
      required to meaningful changes. That is, if the cultural
      artifacts projected a message that threatened the authorities in
      control of mass communication, their interests or their
      narratives, then those cultural artifacts were not repropagated
      to ensure they were never culturally amplified.
      - Because these cultural artificts weren't distributed widely
        enough to take root in enough people's minds, they were easily
        rendered ephemeral by more powerful people who wanted to tell
        another story. These powerful interests feel threatened by
        narratives who wake people up to the corporate bullshit
        systemically siphoning wealth from people, thereby creating
        and perpuating poverty. That narrative isn't exactly good for
        business.
    - For people who legally owned recording studios, radio stations,
      record labels, music retailers, as long as they worked together
      to ensure the only people who could create cultural artifacts
      with significance were "approved", then they could ensure they
      could stifle true progress for as long as possible, all
      perpetuating the narrative that those in power never intended to
      do so. This is all patently false, of course.
      - After the democratization of music production equipment...

### &#9314; Layering Effects

- other basic techniques:
  - articulating motion or exaggerating the amount of movement
  - gestures and body language
    - everything in poplocking starts with basic hiphop dance and
      gestures, layering everything in on top of that

#### Vitruvian Man as the Zero Form for Dirichlet Energy

- dirichlet energy and interpreting body language

![Vitruvian Man]()


- this is all geometric mechanics
  - [parametric pendulum](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eC_TJeLcZ6A)
  - [parametric resonance](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hi_4SsbwaeE)
  - every position on a
    [double pendulum](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Double_pendulum)
    maps to the surface on a torus. here, this is why the
    configuration space can be mapped using a manifold.
    - for a double pendulum, the manifold transforms angles describing
      the system into coordinates on the surface of a torus.
    - to mimic the mechanical constraints of a joint, the surface of
      the torus can be limited to including only valid values of
      theta1 & theta2.
  - to symbolically enumerate the possible configurations of a n-joint
    system, one can discretize the space of (theta[1] .. theta[n]) or
    the surface of the toroidally generated shape.

- this distretized, symbolic enumeration of the (configuration space
  of body positions), forms a graph structure, through which paths
  emerge
  - these paths are either time-based or sequential lists of movements
    (indexed by n, their order in the move-sequence)
    - regardless, these paths across the configuration-space graph
      represented mini-routines, but are monadic in nature.
    - further, they themselves form a higher-order graph of sequences
      where each element in the sequence is an element in the
      configuration space graph
      - this is very similar to time-series on graphs (link article on
        time-series on discrete networks)
  - loops across this configuration-space graph are very interesting
    - examples: cyclic tuts and their partially parameterized cyclic
      tut counterparts (viz. keep some of the motifs of the tut cycle
      in tact, but variate some other aspects of them.)
    - regardless of how you think about dancing and pop-locking, at a
      minimum, you must understand something that approximates these
      methods and abstract models of movement to be sufficiently good
      at tutting (and especially finger-tutting)
      - that is, your metacognition must emulate something similar to
        these processes in order to be like a dytto for finger tuts or
        a B-Boy thesis for groundwork.
      - however, your metacognition and cognition of these things is
        probably more engrained into intuition, which actually makes
        it that much more useful for your particular skillset, which
        could be dancing, sports, martial arts, etc.
        - conscious thought is slow, but you condition your
          subconscious intuition through routines of mind and by
          developing mental habits
        - in other words, these people have very highly developed
          minds and the potential to be highly intelligent, whether
          they know it or not.
  - paths through a network are most interesting when they have or
    when they share higher-order features like cycles or path-types

### Definition of space, topology

- area/volume of pixels/voxels body parts moved (relative/absolute)
  - the global movement, change in movement, laplacian of change in
    movement, density in volume (=~ kinematics deformation), some
    method of measuring the laplacian in orientation of motion
  - each pixel/voxel has a structure with it representing space change
    - original & new voxel space coords along with metrics
      parameterizing those.
  - this forms a topological overlay giving you a neighborhood of
    absolute/relative pixel motion
    - and changes in other pixel values & laplacian of those
  - a space based on tracking the joint/surface locations of the body
    over time, accross relative & absolute changes in space
    - &#8855; as a representational approximation of a graph)
    - &#8855; gradually increasing timesteps space trace
    - this space gives you an indexed data structure for
      retrieval/calculations on which to base regional/global metrics
      on the system as a whole


#### (a discrete version of something like [this hopf-for-simplicial-complices](https://arxiv.org/abs/1505.04458))

  - and provides calculation/addressing/storage/retrieval of metrics
    parameterized by the combinatorial space of the domain of joints
    or body surface elements (both relative & absolute)

### Representations of form/mutation on the space/topologies (move?)

- a representation algorithm that provides a metric for distances b/w
  various "form" (both symbolic) the spaces/metric
  - a overlay of symbolicly represented forms might map those created
    by the above representation alg/index/metric
  - these symbolic representations should be mappable to forms that
    are actually human-recognizable and human-comprensible symbolic
- a measure of general/specific complexity of body forms and body
  motions

# Discrete Differential Geometry and Pop Locking

- discrete differential geometry to help define configuration spaces
  for joints in a body, where the distance between connected joints
  cannot change.
  - this is distinguished from the usual discrete differential algebra
  - the goal is to come up with a framework for specifying rhythmic
    movements of *any jointed body*, not just any jointed human body.
    - i.e. you could take any 3D mesh's skeleton and generate a
      framework foxr producing mesh morphs. so apply this higher-order
      functional math to a 3D mesh and skeleton and produce functions
      that enable you to move it rhythmically

- look up [Discrete Exterior Calculus]() for info on how to generate
  domains for body (parameterization/indexes/etc)

### Combinatorial Generation of Involutes in the Configuration Space

- isolations are involutes
- involutes are essentially unrollings of lines/planes
  - if you have a finite-length string and you hold one fixpoint, the
    involute is the set of curves that emerge from moving the free
    point to anywhere it can be moved and altering its curve in any
    way that length of unfixed string allows
  - also works with infinite length strings, but makes a bit more
    sense if you can hold two points fixed, but move the points

- so, with the language dancer's use, involutes describe the set of
  possible isolations where one point is fixed at a joint and the
  other joints are free to move anywhere.
  - with isolations, you could also hold several joints in place and
    try to imagine the isolations available with the joints between
    them.



- so in a jointed, discrete system where the distance between points
  is constant and motions of jointed 1-segments are constraint by the
  mechanics of those joints (i.e. shoulder joints only permit the
  segment to move at angles relative to the shoulder joint)
  - you identify a generator, which is a map for enumerating the space
    of available configurations of that joint.
    - the generator is a kind of higher-order manifold. it takes a set
      of joint positions with specifid constraints on motion
    - when given a set of new points for each joint, where the length
      of the segments is the same and the joint motion constraints are
      held, it produces a configuration of a body or 3D mesh skeleton
      that is essentially the body's position.
    - there is a higher-order kind of manifold on top of the 3D-mesh
      skeleton generator.
      - the manifold essentially enables metrics and distances that
        are held, so that the enumerated 3D-mesh skeletons can be
        constrained in some way.
      - e.g. for an arm from the shoulder down, you can say, enumerate
        the combinations of all body positions where divide each
        joint's range of valid motions into n-different angles.
        - for example, the elbow can move almost 180 degrees. if you
          want to combinate through the space of configurations for
          the arm, you can look at a set of mesh-skeleton positions at
          values of 180/n.
          - if n is 6, your looking at mesh-skeletons where the elbow
            is at 0, 30,60, 90,120, 150 and 180 degrees.
          - the rest of the joints are combinated similarly.
      - this way, the configurations for a mesh can all be enumerated,
        but there is a set of metrics (distance methods) that can tell
        you how "similar" a mesh skeleton configuration is to another.

### Evolutes

- check over this, how much does the evolute have to do with dancing
  and permuting different configurations of a jointed body? the
  involute makes a ton more sense (remove...)
- evolutes describe curves that emerge from a curve by selecting
  points... (define properly: it only works for this context when
  imagining the curves in a short line with low curvature. i.e. a
  straight line, with minor variation; otherwise the evolute changes
  in very unpredictable ways that aren't useful)
  - (depending on the curve?) when the normals of a curve result in
    evolutes that are increasingly closer to the original curve, the
    evolute that results is simply the original curve. the curve that
    is its own evolute is a straight line.
  - but if a curve is selected whose curvature can be changed
    slightly, there is a space of possible evolutes that emerges.
  - now look at the area (or volume) of difference between the curve
    and its evoluted form. the greater the area, the more motion.
    - for pop-locking this is more visually appealing. larger waves
      through the body look better, although the wave doesn't describe
      evolutes.
    - if your body is in a certain configuration, you might want to
      move it to assume the evolute of that position, for a range of
      joints. no one would ever consciously think of dancing in this
      way, but the idea is to create rhythmic distortion of a jointed
      body. the more distortion, as long as it's coherent and
      rhythmic, usually results in more visually appealing moves.


### describe math behind poplocking

- combinating sets of joints in human (and other bodies)
  - as balls/neighborhood for the enumeration of set pairs for
    isolation
  - "hilbert space"-like concepts for application/optimization of
    movement functions across
  - a universalizeable method for how the human mind can "score" the
    motion and correlation of motion in poplocking movement functions
    applied to pairs of isolation, applied to maximize score by
    observing the gradient of the optimal selected "hilbert space" for
    the isolation pairing
    - this "hilbert space" might not actually be a hilbert space. i'm
      probably confusing it for something else (draw a picture?)
    - how this universalizeable scoring method for perceiving
      poplocking motions is also related to
      driving/coordinating/choosing
      - that is there are overlapping domains for domain-types (types:
        scoring/driving/choosing)
    - so because these structures overlap, there is an AI notion of
      ping-ponging with the function applications of domains &
      domain-type structures (for domain types [A & B: (A), (A,B),
      (A,B,A2), (A,B,A2,B2)]
      - so the person driving the motions is utilizing generalized
        polynomial expansions across the combinatorial enumerated
        domains [A & B: (A), (A,B), (A,B,A2), (A,B,A2,B2)]
      - if the person perceiving is engaging their brain as attuned
        with experience, then they are running similar algorithms to
        optimize with [A & B: (B), (B,A), (B, A, B1)]
        - i.e. this translates into a mathematic modeling of: what i
          think, what i think you think, what i think you think i
          think

- (rewrite referencing the above definitions of topology/etc)
- and, for both functions A (driving motions/behaviors) and
  B (scoring/analyzing motions/behaviors):
  - what's happening here is that there is some metaphysical solution
    that the brain is trying to emulate by finding an analytical
    solution
    - the analytical solution can be mapped to some structure of
      neurons. the structure of neurons would not usually map
      one-to-one with the structure of the analytical solution
      - the analytical sol'n may not map one to one with the numerical
        sol'n, but it rarely may.
      - i know that the numerical sol'n for some problems is not
        modelable for some problems. in order to solve the problem
        with incomplete knowledge of the parameters (i.e. in some
        useful way)
        - then an analytical sol'n is required and solutions are not
          necessarily/ordinarily/usually exact, especially if the
          solution requires learning weights to the problem

### Martial Arts Styles Usually Incorporate Energy Minimization/Conservation/Focus

> "Be Water, My Friend..." -

- fighting style in martial arts, as it relates to the minimization of
  energy.
  - when and how does the aesthetic of the minimization of energy
    present itself in a fighting style?
- here, i mean physical energy minimization
  - usually high deformation translates into high dirichlet energy

### (Maybe it's own section)

- in poplocking, when you are low to the ground, you have higher
  potential for dirichlet energy and higher dirichlet "work" over
  time. for two reasons, at least:
  - you have a greater potential for relative or absolute movement of
    any joint/limb
  - to move at all, you have

- (dirichlet energy is always positive because it's based on an
  integral of non-negative numbers or norms)

- higher expression of dirichlet work -- i.e. work or, if considered
  in a sociophysical sense, a change in momentum
  - almost

- it's tough at first and requires more physical energy expenditure,
  but:
  - (1) most body positions provide a good base to balance for
    isolations
  - (2) you have to be more creative, more technical and, most of all,
    more confident in your movements

- however, it's easy to overuse it and it's often overly abstract

### With Poplocking/Dancing, The More Physical Energy, The More Expressive You Can Be

- expression in poplocking requires high dirichlet energy to distort
  the body for more dense articulation of motion
  - this requires more motion, thus more physical energy

### (Inefficiencies in Relearning)

- an inefficiancy arises when the human mind must relearn patterns of
  motion (or some abstract behavior/expression)
  - this is bc the mind is finding the structure for some analytical
    solution (ALL of which [sometimes] for a problem are combinatorial
    enumerable using binomials or combinatorials, at least to some
    degree of polynomial)
  - when it settles on a non-ideal solution to the problem or does not
    use a polynomial-expansion to describe values of weights, or the
    physical neural network representing that analytical solution is
    damaged, then the mind must repair itself by transforming the
    neural network from (A <- (B -> C))
    - where it's trying to simply go from (B -> A), but because it
      must transform its existing structure, it cannot
    - it instead must try to find some (B -> C), where C is the
      closest approximate solution to A from B

- ... maybe transition to something else... lulz
  - the above is relevant...

- connection to negative occupational therapy
  - how this explains why it's expensive to unlearn
  - why negative OT & cognitive behavioral therapy will systemically
    burden our population with unnecessary complexes
  - unlearning these anxieties, conditioned behaviors, neuroses and
    conditions is incredibly expensive for the brain & mind
    - especially when they are systemic in the person's psychology
      (i.e. the person's mind is overly dependent on or suffers as a
      whole because of these unnecessary, intended problems)
  - when a negative effect is intended through CBT and Occupational
    Therapy, it means the people designing these "treatments" are
    trying to maximize the negative effects and thus, trying to
    maximize the extent to which a persons mind/behavior becomes
    dependent on suggestion
- who the fuck pays for this shit when it goes horribly wrong? who
  does that benefit? why would someone want this for america if it
  redirects(WASTES) the wealth we generate from GDP


* thoughts on algorithms for poplocking both humans and non-human
  jointed objects,
* generalizations to AI & psychology,
* how negatively-intended cognitive behavior therapy unnecessarily:
  burdens our society and benefits liberals who are using it for
  harassment and mind control.
