===========

- terminology:
  - settle on clear distinctions b/w governance, government, etc
    (governmental) so that it's more general. this connects to social
    systems of any size, but especially to those systems with
    well-defined rules (for....)
  - clearly distinguish resource from resource type from an
    instantiation of a resource type

- fluid dynamics
  - viscocity
  - turbudity
  - LCD terminology

### Permeability of Individuals to Information

- how individuals' permeability to information changes with age
  - further, the number of generations living simultaneously in a
    society affects the typology of social interactions, globally
  - the viscocity of information exchanged between them is affected by
    intergenerational dynamics
  - experience tends to (petrify) internalized information systems. as
    people age, they accumulate a greater variety of experiences to
    draw on. this tends to reinforce the analytical systems our brains
    process.

### Life Expectancy and Dynamics of Intergenerational Social Influence

- when the number of generations simultaneously alive contracts,
  expands or is otherwise systematically impacted, it impacts the
  mechanics, dynamics and frequencies of the typology of
  intergenerational social interactions.
  - consider alzheimer's disease. if the rates of alzheimers or
    disease progression timelines were to increase, what macroscopic
    effects would that have on social interactions?
  - japan's life expectancy is 85 years. for nation's whose life
    expectancy is a decade or two less, how does that affect how
    individuals of various generations influence each other?
  - over the next decades, as the average life expectancy crosses 100
    years and then 120 years, how are intergenerational dynamics
    impacted systemically

###

- a discussion in Plato's Republic concerns the perhaps cyclic
  progression of governmental forms
  - what were the factors Plato/Socrates listed as driving this
    progression?
  - how does this description intersect with a total generalization of
    governance?
  -

main outline
===========

- this is a collection of notes that have accumulated. These seek to
  generalize systems of governance by decontructing (any instantiation
  of a system of government) in terms of how that entity and its
  (citizens) relate to three (most general) sociophysical resource
  types. specifically insofar as how they:
    - initially accumulate
    - preserve and acquire
    - interact with
    - attempt to control
    - provide networked access to
    - etc.

- think of any implementation of some given ideology or an ism,
  disdained or self-proclaimed. imagine perhaps some fantasy realm's
  theocracy, a group of tribal leaders with influence over regional
  families, or even your precariously unstable junta whose
  revolutionary leadership suffers constant flux.

- for all governmental systems, modeling the mechanics/dynamics of
  society's projection of influence onto three sociophysical resource
  types (dilineates systems of governance ontologically), producing
  measures of correspondence between the sociophysically modeled
  system and the systems studied in political science.
  - overly complicated? inaccurate?
    - i'm not sure the average person would immediately appreciate why
      this is useful. or why it's distinct from "political science
      crossed with data"

- however constructed, if the methods of construction are (effective,
  sufficiently general and clearly connected/clustered around the
  ontological forms of governmental systems defined in political
  science), then one framework can connect all forms of governance.
  - (what does/not make such a system possible) is far less
    interesting than how the interrelations between systems are
    useful,
  - this ontological map of governmental systems connects ... (this
    was kinda important)

- (these three primary sociophysical resources, whose characteristics
  are fundamental and whose implications resound into the
  inter-institutional edifices of that society.)

- financial, social, informational resources and an overview on how
  all forms of government/society can be dilineated based on how they
  control/disseminate (diffuse) these resources

### What are these general Sociophysical Resource Types?

- social resources
- financial resources
- informational resources (which encompass the previous two types)
  - since all social/financial interactions produce information and
    are determined by information's influence on behavior

- multiple simple examples of each resource type

- ok that is what it is. there are resources, some people have them,
  some lack them. this is straightforward.

- reflect on this quote from Twilight of the Idols...

> Things the Germans Lack

- what's less straightforward than the (possession/etc) of resources
  in proportion to the people around you is...
- for various groups and institutions in society, their patterns of
  resource utilization (for resources of these types in relation to
  those of other resource types)
  - and critically (their projection influence onto resources of a
    type) comes at the expense of "spending in the other direction" --
    though not so simply as to be additive or linear.
  - (for groups whose potential energy gives them relative complete
    dominance over other groups in their domain), it is the projection
    of influence and (intentional orientation) thereof that causes
    less dominant groups to respond *economically* by orienting their
    projection of influence toward unchallenged less resistant
    (pathways or conduits of influence) ... uhg rewrite this

### Viscocity of Sociophysical Resource Exchange

- that is, any arbitrary system of governance establishes (in/formal)
  processes that prioritize the direction of that system's (potential
  authority/influence) towards instantiations of the three resource
  types, with "preference" towards some types over others.
  - however, for individuals and small social groups, the projection
    of influence by dominant groups effectively stagnates many of the
    potential (conduits) for exchange of social, financial,
    informational. If the smaller players are to reap greater gains
    from the expenditure of sociophysical resources, then they
    seek less resistant routes of influence-exchange.
    - Thus, trends emerge where the people respond unconsciously to
      the state's direction of power by investing their sociophysical
      resources to what provides or allows for freedom. From the
      channels of exchange for sociophysical resources, this freedom
      is the ability to move both yourself and your resources, without
      the imposition of resistance, along open sociophysical channels
      of exchange -- financial, social or informational.
    - when dominant powers impose their interests, rules and norms
      onto the shared sociophysical fabric of exchange, drag in the
      motion along the threads in that fabric generally render
      (ineffectual) self-directed motion

- This results in the tendancy for a government to focus on a primary
  and secondary resource type. The channels of exchange for these two
  types are relatively viscous, leaving the third type

- trichotomous

- to the design of the system, second-order effects may be
  unintential, but can be critical to the system's intended function,
  whether its (participants or designers) are cognizant of those
  secondary effects. (especially true of less-formally defined systems
  of governance)



### These resources form a kind of Triumvirate

- introduce the notion of triumvirate before/after discussing (..types
  in relation to other types)

- usually, the governmental system seeks to control two of these
  resource types

- as the senses were dilineated phenomenologically by plato, each
  sense is shown to be distinct in their presentation to the mind
  (etc..)
  - similarly, there are fundamental differences between resources of
    each type.


### Capitalism? Democracy?


### Deconstruct Communism in these terms

- according to this s/phys theory of governance, demonstrate that
  communism, as defined/constructed by marxist thought-leaders, is the
  zenith of totalitarianism, as is any system which methodically
  dominates all resources of the three types, according to its
  ideological principles.
  - socialism/communism start as systems that focus on social-type
    resources, often because of the (exploitation and obselescence of
    the poor) by that society's elite, who dominate financial-type
    resources.
  - communists, especially those employing lenins ideas of pragma
    (etc..), start with what is available: the social resources of the
    proletariate; resources that are all-but-useless to the
    bougeuosie.
    - they start with social-type resources, until they gain power
      (through ideological mindshare and by establishing their
      movement throughout a nation slowly, but steadily forward.
    - after gaining and holding social-type resources, they can turn
      towards financial-type resources, as long as the distribution of
      these financially affluent newfound roles in the social
      hierarchy don't sow derision among more influential party
      members
      - the accumulation of mindshare is key for balance here, as the
        party members need to think and act as one (otherwise as top
        party members gain power, corruption results, though this is
        inevitable with governmental systems that monopolize social
        resources)
        - (note that such movements begin with slowly/steadily seeding
          information through social networks ... to people considered
          irrelevant, invisible and inconsequential by the powers that
          be)

    - after the attainment of sociohierarchical territory necessary to
      influence sufficient financial resources, the party can gain
      near-total dominance over the social distribution &
      accessibility of information-type resources
      - e.g. by upscale its expenditures on media/messaging/etc
      - by depriving party opposition of income
  - lenin's development of pragma, both as an idea and as policy
    implementaitons, strongly rooted itself into the bolshevik
    movement.
    - this shifts tension from potentially revolution-ending, early
      violent conflict to slow and steady social conflict
    - this is very similar to much of the dark social violence i've
      seen in america over the past decade.
      - exploitation of social games to perturb regions of social
        hierarchy
      - the use of language in an attemp to control thought.



- it's what them
- "Communism failed"
  - "That wasn't real communism."
