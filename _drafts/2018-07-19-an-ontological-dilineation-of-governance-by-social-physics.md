- consensus on policy, operations and interface (w/ public, governed,
  etc)

- summarizing many of my philosophical ideas in one word that
  addresses and balances metamodernism: finalism

misc
===========

- terminology:
  - settle on clear distinctions b/w governance, government, etc
    (governmental) so that it's more general. this connects to social
    systems of any size, but especially to those systems with
    well-defined rules (for....)
  - clearly distinguish resource from resource type from an
    instantiation of a resource type

- fluid dynamics
  - viscocity
  - turbudity
  - LCD terminology

- [Open Source Governance
  Models: From BDFL to Consensus Seeking](http://www.nodesummit.com/prior-video/node-summit-2017-open-source-governance-models-from-bdfl-to-consensus-seeking-myles-borins/)
  - Governance in business: management, internally/externally facing
    policy, board of directors.

### Permeability of Individuals to Information

- how individuals' permeability to information changes with age
  - further, the number of generations living simultaneously in a
    society affects the typology of social interactions, globally
  - the viscocity of information exchanged between them is affected by
    intergenerational dynamics
  - experience tends to (petrify) internalized information systems. as
    people age, they accumulate a greater variety of experiences to
    draw on. this tends to reinforce the analytical systems our brains
    process.

### Life Expectancy and Dynamics of Intergenerational Social Influence

- when the number of generations simultaneously alive contracts,
  expands or is otherwise systematically impacted, it impacts the
  mechanics, dynamics and frequencies of the typology of
  intergenerational social interactions.
  - consider alzheimer's disease. if the rates of alzheimers or
    disease progression timelines were to increase, what macroscopic
    effects would that have on social interactions?
  - japan's life expectancy is 85 years. for nation's whose life
    expectancy is a decade or two less, how does that affect how
    individuals of various generations influence each other?
  - over the next decades, as the average life expectancy crosses 100
    years and then 120 years, how are intergenerational dynamics
    impacted systemically

###

- a discussion in Plato's Republic concerns the perhaps cyclic
  progression of governmental forms
  - what were the factors Plato/Socrates listed as driving this
    progression?
  - how does this description intersect with a total generalization of
    governance?

### Already becoming communist without even understanding why

- We're already gravitating closer to Communism or other totalitarian
  systems of governance. Why?
  - Social media is prepping us to have tightly regulated social
    resources. Social media must quantifies social interaction, so
    that algorithms can influence it. At the moment, there is no over
    ideological bent to how Facebook regulates social interaction, but
    we are creating many of the same tools to do so, accompanied by
    the cultivation of social responses to the ubiquity of data-driven
    social manipulation.
    - These social responses include economic responses -- SEO and
      more behavioral responses where groups collectively work
      together to manage their own social resources not unlike how
      commercial groups facilitate commerce of financial
      resources. When people organize around a facebook group and use
      the community for the benefit of the admins, they are
      facillitating commerce of social resources.
    - Other social responses include the development of beliefs,
      social norms and the reflections of each -- i.e. beliefs about
      norms, norms of belief, beliefs about belief, etc.
    - Society is adapting to the changes in viscosity of resources: of
      social-type, financial-type and informational-type. The systems
      are fast-evolving and complex; they don't so simply permit those
      on the inside from understanding how the systems are changing.
  - At the same time, mechanisms for value accumulation, storage and
    commerce that involve primarily financial resources will become
    less viable. This will pace economic problems; as liquidity
    becomes scarce and the distribution of economic opportunities
    becomes more restricted, this eliminates savings as a store of
    value and generally makes financial resources less accessible. The
    result is that people will gravitate towards the commerce of
    influence using what is available and less viscous: social and
    informational resources, but we will find those are difficult to
    exchange as well.

- therefore, our societal and governmental systems will approach the
   zenith of totalitarian configuration, regardless of the nominal
   ideology its supporters rally behind or what anyone names it in the
   end.

main outline
===========

- this is a collection of notes that have accumulated. These seek to
  generalize systems of governance by decontructing (any instantiation
  of a system of government) in terms of how that entity and its
  (citizens) relate to three (most general) sociophysical resource
  types. specifically insofar as how they:
    - initially accumulate
    - preserve and acquire
    - interact with
    - attempt to control
    - provide networked access to
    - etc.

- think of any implementation of some given ideology or an ism,
  disdained or self-proclaimed. imagine perhaps some fantasy realm's
  theocracy, a group of tribal leaders with influence over regional
  families, or even your precariously unstable junta whose
  revolutionary leadership suffers constant flux.

- for all governmental systems, modeling the mechanics/dynamics of
  society's projection of influence onto three sociophysical resource
  types (dilineates systems of governance ontologically), producing
  measures of correspondence between the sociophysically modeled
  system and the systems studied in political science.
  - overly complicated? inaccurate?
    - i'm not sure the average person would immediately appreciate why
      this is useful. or why it's distinct from "political science
      crossed with data"

- however constructed, if the methods of construction are (effective,
  sufficiently general and clearly connected/clustered around the
  ontological forms of governmental systems defined in political
  science), then one framework can connect all forms of governance.
  - (what does/not make such a system possible) is far less
    interesting than how the interrelations between systems are
    useful,
  - this ontological map of governmental systems connects ... (this
    was kinda important)

- (these three primary sociophysical resources, whose characteristics
  are fundamental and whose implications resound into the
  inter-institutional edifices of that society.)

- financial, social, informational resources and an overview on how
  all forms of government/society can be dilineated based on how they
  control/disseminate (diffuse) these resources

### What are these general Sociophysical Resource Types?

- social resources
- financial resources
- informational resources (which encompass the previous two types)
  - since all social/financial interactions produce information and
    are determined by information's influence on behavior

- multiple simple examples of each resource type

- what are the kernels of these resource types?
  - they are informational:
    - information necessary for finance
    - that necessary for social (...)
    - that necessary for the acquisition and development of knowledge,
      which is solely informational
  - how does understanding these kernels empower individuals to become
    affluent in influencing financial, social and informational
    resources?
    - what are the minimal levels of knowledge required for each? how
      do we construct institutions in society for
      propagating/inculcating knowledge of the three?
      - what are the institutions for development of knowledge of
        social resources?
        - religious institutions, belief systems, families, etc.
        - some of these are more effective than others.


- ok that is what it is. there are resources, some people have them,
  some lack them. this is straightforward.

- reflect on this quote from Twilight of the Idols...

> Things the Germans Lack

- what's less straightforward than the (possession/etc) of resources
  in proportion to the people around you is...
- for various groups and institutions in society, their patterns of
  resource utilization (for resources of these types in relation to
  those of other resource types)
  - and critically (their projection influence onto resources of a
    type) comes at the expense of "spending in the other direction" --
    though not so simply as to be additive or linear.
  - (for groups whose potential energy gives them relative complete
    dominance over other groups in their domain), it is the projection
    of influence and (intentional orientation) thereof that causes
    less dominant groups to respond *economically* by orienting their
    projection of influence toward unchallenged less resistant
    (pathways or conduits of influence) ... uhg rewrite this

### Viscocity of Sociophysical Resource Exchange

- that is, any arbitrary system of governance establishes (in/formal)
  processes that prioritize the direction of that system's (potential
  authority/influence) towards instantiations of the three resource
  types, with "preference" towards some types over others.
  - however, for individuals and small social groups, the projection
    of influence by dominant groups effectively stagnates many of the
    potential (conduits) for exchange of social, financial,
    informational. If the smaller players are to reap greater gains
    from the expenditure of sociophysical resources, then they
    seek less resistant routes of influence-exchange.
    - Thus, trends emerge where the people respond unconsciously to
      the state's direction of power by investing their sociophysical
      resources to what provides or allows for freedom. From the
      channels of exchange for sociophysical resources, this freedom
      is the ability to move both yourself and your resources, without
      the imposition of resistance, along open sociophysical channels
      of exchange -- financial, social or informational.
    - when dominant powers impose their interests, rules and norms
      onto the shared sociophysical fabric of exchange, drag in the
      motion along the threads in that fabric generally render
      (ineffectual) self-directed motion

- This results in the tendancy for a government to focus on a primary
  and secondary resource type. The channels of exchange for these two
  types are relatively viscous, leaving the channels of the third type
  less viscous
  - 6 permutations of priotization of control, but to simplify, focus
    on the three types, distinguished by the primary mechanisms set
    to: financial, social and informational. i.e. what does it imply
    when each is the channel with highest viscosity?
    - correlate this to the formula for physical viscosity. viz. what
      is the S.I. quantity in physical fluids that causes viscosity?
    - how does viscosity lead to stagnation of mutation rates for:
      - finanical channels of exchange (and social/informational)
  - herein, can mechanisms of all types become stagnated?
    - if so, what does this mean for the common person's experience in
      such a governmental system?
  - when financial exch. mech. exhibit the greatest stagnation, this
    reduces the "turnover rates" for financial control
  - when social exch. mech. exhibit the greatest stagnation,
    similarly, this leads to perpetuated social hierachies
  - when informational exchange mechanisms exhibit the greatest
    stagnation, this leads to suppression of memetic mutation rates

- explain how diffeomorphic analysis of spaces enables digital video
  processing, but also applies to any topological spaces, even the
  topology of the metaphysical.

- (diffeomorphically, of the three configurations above), the
  viscosity of informational resources is the most interesting, from a
  neo-kantian perspective on epistemology. when the idea of kantian
  categories are applied to nascent developments in the structures of
  knowledge, then from this lens, the (opening/developing) paths
  forward are considered.
  - when this lens is (clouded), then the futuristic anticipations of
    the future that diffuse (popularly) into that society become
    anachronistic -- and often humorously so.
  - when such a lens is clear and widely propagated by thought
    leaders, then the surface of impending scientific, academic and
    phenomenological developments becomes well known.
    - two examples of this happening:
      - (1) western civilization's propulsion towards the inevitability of
        modernism from the 17th through the early 20th centuries.
        - explain this a bit.
        - examples: the rockefellers and gas/oil investment versus
          investment in eletrical infrastructure and the technological
          devleopments thereof
          - Before Tesla's development of alternating current, for
            General Electric and other magnates of industry, the
            unfurling of electronic technological development into
            industry was to be slow and controlled. (They) saw no
            other way to package infrastructure implementation and
            delivery of electricity to consumers by direct current,
            which starkly limited
          - The early telecom industry did, however, seem to foresee
            the development of digital technologies, eventually,
            though they greatly misestimated the complexity of
            electronics required
      - (2) never again, would this lens (reverberate with clarity) in
        the minds of thought leaders -- until the era of the internet,
        which set humanity on its current course to rapidly our
        cognizance of (nascent development),
        - where the tools of data science have became democratized,
          this neokantian aperture continues to widen, until no doubt,
          there is no more developments humanity alone will be capable
          of realizing.
        - present day applications of neokantian diffeomorphic
          analysis of epistemic structures: the fields of
          - patent data science (expand on patent data science)
          - biotech investments

- trichotomous

- (... segue) to the design of the system, second-order effects may be
  unintential, but can be critical to the system's intended function,
  whether its (participants or designers) are cognizant of those
  secondary effects. (especially true of less-formally defined systems
  of governance)

### These resources form a kind of Triumvirate

- this and the definitions of resources need to be introduced earlier.
- introduce the notion of triumvirate before/after discussing (..types
  in relation to other types)

- usually, the governmental system seeks to control two of these
  resource types

- as the senses were dilineated phenomenologically by plato, each
  sense is shown to be distinct in their presentation to the mind
  (etc..)
  - similarly, there are fundamental differences between resources of
    each type.

### Mandala Theory (X) Unified Ontological Theory of Governance

- what does it mean for interactions between neighbors of various
  types of governance systems?
  - i am likely to compete with my neighbor, my neighbor is likely to
    compete with me and it's neighbors, but to develop independence
    from local resource constraints, then if i cooperate with my
    neighbor's neighbors, i am likely to find that the adversary of my
    adversaries presents useful mechanisms of influence in political
    theory
  - geopolitically and economically, how do these insights extrapolate
    in the context of specific compositions for local governmental
    systems?
    - in the modern era -- especially that of the post-war era, how
      did dominance over regional political interests lead to the need
      to control the political thinking (and implementation) of entire
      regions?
    - can communism or extreme socialism ever be expected to succeed
      in isolation? iran in the post-war era is perhaps a counterpoint
      to the soviet union's extreme dominance over politics for
      self-perservation.
      - to the latter, was their need for regional dominance moreso a
        practical necessity of ideology or an extrapolation of
        Russia's need for influence over Eastern Europe and the Altaic
        regions for geopolitical (reassurance) and security? whereof,
        this need has been a common theme and motivating factor
        driving Russian policy since the 17th century.

- (back to mandala theory), consider the evolutionary trajectories
  along this ontological space connecting forms of government
  - combined with the specific influneces that neighboring &
    hierarchical groups exert

### Capitalism? Democracy?


### Deconstruct Communism in these terms

- according to this s/phys theory of governance, demonstrate that
  communism, as defined/constructed by marxist thought-leaders, is the
  zenith of totalitarianism, as is any system which methodically
  dominates all resources of the three types, according to its
  ideological principles.
  - socialism/communism start as systems that focus on social-type
    resources, often because of the (exploitation and obselescence of
    the poor) by that society's elite, who dominate financial-type
    resources.
  - communists, especially those employing lenins ideas of pragma
    (etc..), start with what is available: the social resources of the
    proletariate; resources that are all-but-useless to the
    bougeuosie.
    - they start with social-type resources, until they gain power
      (through ideological mindshare and by establishing their
      movement throughout a nation slowly, but steadily forward.
    - after gaining and holding social-type resources, they can turn
      towards financial-type resources, as long as the distribution of
      these financially affluent newfound roles in the social
      hierarchy don't sow derision among more influential party
      members
      - the accumulation of mindshare is key for balance here, as the
        party members need to think and act as one (otherwise as top
        party members gain power, corruption results, though this is
        inevitable with governmental systems that monopolize social
        resources)
        - (note that such movements begin with slowly/steadily seeding
          information through social networks ... to people considered
          irrelevant, invisible and inconsequential by the powers that
          be)

    - after the attainment of sociohierarchical territory necessary to
      influence sufficient financial resources, the party can gain
      near-total dominance over the social distribution &
      accessibility of information-type resources
      - e.g. by upscale its expenditures on media/messaging/etc
      - by depriving party opposition of income
  - lenin's development of pragma, both as an idea and as policy
    implementaitons, strongly rooted itself into the bolshevik
    movement.
    - this shifts tension from potentially revolution-ending, early
      violent conflict to slow and steady social conflict
    - this is very similar to much of the dark social violence i've
      seen in america over the past decade.
      - exploitation of social games to perturb regions of social
        hierarchy
      - the use of language in an attempt to control thought.

- like a bee, leninists can only sting you once and they know it. so
  they run full-scale theatrics and
  - they need to keep their party members engaged because, as with
    religions, if your followers have some kind of ""feeling like there's a purpose to the time they
    contribute.


- it's what them
- "Communism failed"
  - "That wasn't real communism."
