These have mostly occured from

### Wierd Neurological Time-Processing Paradox Dreams

- this should be taken to be a thought experiment, but i cannot
  explain what I've experienced several times after these Spider Bite
  dreams. to the best of my knowledge, the technical neurological
  information is factual, as are the analogies to stream processing in
  computer vision and machine learning. however, i'm trying to explain
  my subjective experience of sensory/causal "time travel" upon waking
  up ... so the overall hypothesis is merely that: a hypothesis that
  may elucidate what happens when streams of neurological signals are
  truncated for long periods of time. no. there is no time travel
  involved. and yes, it could simply be a neurological glitch, but
  often that's where you learn the most about how the brain works.

- basically, i've had two or three "spider-thread" wakeups, where no
  "bite" is involved, but a sensation that a spider is dangling itself
  down onto my face suddenly wakes me in the characteristic rush to
  turn on the lights. in the instinct-driven transition from some
  typically dreamless cycle of sleep to blitzing out of the bed, what
  i remember here is the "idea" that there's a spider directly over my
  face accompanied by long, thin tube-like imagery in total darkness
  that tends to resemble stretching optical networking fibers when i
  reflect back on it. it's not a dream. it's the timeless (tubelike)
  sensation of a Salvia Divinorum trip in near total darkness, but
  here one or two bright colors stretch themselves in a long cone-like
  shape as the visuospatial imagery presented to my consciousness
  morphs into an infinitely tall cylinder. it's wierd. it's this shape
  that gives me the only visual image immediately before I wake up: a
  single thread of spiderweb. yet, it seems this image only
  incidentally accompanies the purely semantic idea of "SPIDER!!" that
  sends me into a blitz, where only mid-sprint does my mind correlate
  the "optic fiber" image and arachnoid.
  - however, one particularly vivid "spider-thread" wakeup left me
    extremely confused about the course of events. As i was running to
    the light-switch to turn them on (and I did flip the switch), my
    immediate (+10s - +60s) examination of my memory of waking up
    included ONLY imagery of my room where the lights were already
    on. And I hit that fucking light switch ... but pouring over all
    the visual data immediately afterwards? The lights were already on
    ... yet, i still had the same nearly pitch-black, thread-like
    imagery of the single strand of web. the lights were off before i
    woke, but all the visual aspects of the memory indicate that from
    the very moment i opened my eyes, the lights were constantly on
    until i was left perplexed about the causal paradox.

- "null and void" - quaternary systems of values have: true, false,
    null, void (or what is essentially void) .. void would indicate
    that the data location is missing/invalid or that returning null
    would be misleading.
- hypothesize that, for data that the brain has never experienced as
  "missing", if this data or the streams that carry it instead
  propagate data almost completely perceived as "null and void", then
  the brain's tendency to fill in the gaps of its experience may step
  into overdrive. memory of spatial relationships is nearly useless
  without the sensory data necessary to orient oneself in
  space. still, it would still be possible to operate on memory alone,
  even if visual streams are perceived as "null and void".
  - but, if i jumped out of bed and hit the light switch while an
    infinitessimally rare glitch caused visual data streams be
    perceived as void, then how would my consciousness perceive this
    this course of events? looking forward, if there was no visual
    data, and my mind was operating on autopilot with deeply engrained
    spatial data about the layout of my bedroom, then perhaps my mind
    filled in the blanks with a visual patchwork of imagery overlaid
    on top.
    - (while dealing with inconsistency of thought/memory immediately
      following an abrupt interruption of sleep) if my brain did so,
      while receiving nearly zero visual input, then perhaps it
      reconstructed it's memory of rushing to the lightswitch with
      zero awareness of the lights being off. hence, looking back on
      my own memory, the lights appeared on the whole time, even
      though i clearly remembered the sensation of the strong "snap"
      exhibited by my over-tightened, loud bedroom lightswitch. the
      two elements of memory: the tactile snap of the lightswitch and
      that it did not visually change the state of the lights are
      incompatible. time travel? probably not. is my hypothesis
      correct? i'm so far out on weak assumptions that Occam's razor
      is in pieces, but assuming my recall of the experience *was*
      valid, then there are three possibilities: (1) time travel (2)
      aliens (3) or something else.
    - if i'm correct, then i believe that the thinned cylindrical
      spider thread, with its strange filaments of bright red and
      orange are simply a result of extremely limited visual
      processing. basically something is malfunctioning in occipital
      lobe, the "points of sensory convergence" in the thalamus, where
      auditory pathways approach the visual pathways, or in the
      optical chiasm. far more likely than the former two, the latter
      is spatially centralized and maintains fairly direct pathways
      throughout its X shape until it reaches the occipital lobe.
    - it is well-known that the mind tiles in patches of visual data,
      overlaid on top of a (sparsely updated constraints on the
      arrangement of objects in space.) this process operates
      similarly to a computer-vision CNN in reverse or, more simply, a
      bit like Google Deep Dream. instead of updating "every pixel on
      the screen at every refresh", the mind is more efficient in time
      and energy if it stochastically stitches in patches of imagery
      overtop sparse constraints updated by visual stimuli, as they're
      made available. this implies that the brain operates in
      qualitatively different ways if a person finds themselves in a
      new or unfamiliar environment, until enough information is
      received so that the stochastic "tiling" methods can take over.


#### experience of non-linear time

  - i have experienced non-linear time before, once. it's unbelievably
    confusing to the point of being permanently irreconcilable to the
    person who experiences it. obviously, the other people in that
    situation? they were experiencing time linearly: everything occurs
    in-sequence and there's no skipping around. this was a experience
    in 2005 where for a half-hour, memory of dialogue jumped out of
    sequence and cycled. for me, experiencing time moving forward
    caused me to play and replay fragments of memory and dialogue that
    would occasionally skip backwards and repeat. never eat Amanita
    Muscaria!!! this experience was terrifying for everyone
    involved. still, it left me puzzled as to how my brain would lead
    itself to loop and shuffle 15-60 second fragments of memory until
    it stabalized. the experience implied that, in order to provide
    the emulation leading to the sensation of awareness known as
    consciousness, the brain does some very interesting things to
    permit consciousness to observe and reflect on its while recording
    memory and enabling flexible cognition. and apparently, its very
    possible but exceedingly rare for the experience of consciousness
    to glitch out and expose "chopped and screwed" fragments of
    memory, each seemingly occuring the first time with vague memory
    of that fragment having already occurred. there are other possible
    explanations for what my brain was doing, but the point is: when
    enough processes in the brain become swamped with corrupted data,
    things get weird. the experience of consciousness moving only
    forwards is not guarenteed by the mind -- but it's not time
    travel, obviously.
    - i can't repeat this enough: do not eat those fucking
      mushrooms. they're legal, but they will kill you or worse.
    - why is this phenomena of temporally corrupted consciousness
      possible? because the brain is constantly stream-processing data
      to various parts of itself. keep in mind that this is pure
      speculation. when exhibited at large enough scale, these streams
      of ionic & electrical activity contribute to types of
      brainwaves.  there are several kinds of spatiotemporal
      components to signals being streamed and the information
      representations that are stored in short-term or long-term
      memory. there are some aspects of memory read/write that must
      logically resemble a spatiotemporal tensor decomposition.  if
      such a tensor were corrupted upon contraction in such a way that
      causes data about time & space to be skewed (while seemingly
      preserving the integrity of the data) then this would cause
      comparison of events in time to result in invalid sequences. as
      perceived, the flow of time may accelerate or decelerate, the
      memories associated with experience may seem "sparse" or more
      rich with details, or experience itself could potentially be
      presented to consciousness out of sequence.
      - however, it's far more likely that the mind would not be
        capable of processing such invalid data at all: the signals
        wouldn't simple appear corrupted, they would potentially
        destabalize adjacent neural circuits until normal behavior was
        restored. some mechanism like this might be responsible for
        such phenomena as "beer-recall" where physical representations
        of memory would be more conducive to integrating with adjacent
        circuits or intermediary pathways if the local and global
        chemical state were similar to that when the memories were
        recorded. while beer-recall seems rare, some studies have
        shown that, after studying with adderall, accuracy of recall
        is best when the test is taken on adderal.

- the best way to explain it is that it feels like a salvia trip when
  I wake up. this has only ever happened a handful of times, but seems
  to be connected to the "spider bite" dreams.
  - this is going to be very difficult to explain, but understanding
    what's happening neurologically speaks volumes about how the brain
    seems to stream-process temporal components of experience,
    particularly sensory data.
  - imagine that your brain stopped forwarding data from it's senses
    to the thalamus, but for some reason still permitted itself to
    engage with the world (for a period of 20-30 seconds after waking
    up)
    - how would the brain respond to a sudden cessation of sensory
      data? e.g. imagine that visual data proceeding from the retinas
      through the optic chiasm into the occipital lobe is disconnected
      before waking up. the intermediate layers of visual processing
      in the occipital lobe would stop receiving data (TODO: image
      mapping brain regions to CV algorithm and/or capsule networks)
      - what happens? there is a curious absence of signal from the
        occipital lobe to other regions (e.g. parietal lobe centers
        for object classification and for perception of spatial
        orientation of objects; these two networks are completely)
        - this "absence of signal" may simply be incoherent and
          unintelligible signal that results when sensory streams are
          cut.
