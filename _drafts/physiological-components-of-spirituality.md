# Energetic FLows


### Cerebrospinal Fluid (CSF) And Interstitial Fluid (ISF)

- discuss jim carrey's explanation of CSF flow and how it relates to
  spirituality

- how does ISF differ from CSF?
  - in the VAT(?) what is transferred from the CSF to the ISF (through
    which fluid channels?)
  - much else to refer to here?

### CSF Questions

- what does it absorb in and carry to the spinal, ventricular, and
  cerebellar region?
- what serum components originate in which areas?
- which electrochemical components originate in which areas?

- In which areas does CSF flux depend on:
  - (1) hydrostatic pressure and
    -  to areas which can encourage fluid flow via mechaical motion
  - (2) osmotic pressure
    - the cerebellar/ventricular regions are less "networked" and
      thus, likely rely moreso on osmotic pressure
  - these are my best-educated assumptions

### Neuroelectrical Energy Flow

- by "neuroelectrical energy flow"
  - i mean to understand the body's energetic flows as they relate to
    the holistic system, not as they correlate centrally to the
    CNS/PNS
  - Peripheral NS, Central NS

- what are the relationships b/w:
  - the surface area of each section of the spinal dermatome,
  - the diameter of the spinal nerves that supply it
  - and the density/quantity of nerve endings it supplies?
  - and the amount of electrical energy its ennervation transmits back
    up through the spine?

### Motion, Compression, Tension and (Joint Compaction)

- how do these active factors affect ISF/CSF?
  - Neuroelectrical Energy Flow?

### Movement of Energy Through the Spine

- afferent/efferent nerves
  - placement




# Physiological Explanations for Spiritual (Practices)

### Yoga

- [Yoga Physiology](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yoga_physiology)
  - gland stimulation
  - fluid flux through muscles
  - increased local capillary pressure
  - decreased local arterial/vein flow where a yoga posture cuts off
    large veins
- while breathing with high oxygenation, when taking particular
  medications when stimulating your diet with (all-natural food-based)
  supplements, then there will be higher plasma concentrations of
  oxygen, food, nutrition, etc
  - therefore, the *slight* multiplier effect *over the time one holds
    a yoga pose* combines with the effect of plasma concentrations of
    anything carried by the blood
    - or lymph concentrations of anything pumped through the lymphatic
      system. or the ISF/CSF concentrations of anything carried
      through the ISF/CSF systems
    - therefore, higher plasma concentrations of both beneficial and
      toxic substances can be delivered at *slightly higher rates* at
      least *for short periods of time*.
      - with proper breathing technique and proper "capture" of blood
        flow distorion via body posture (pressuring artery/vein) the
        delivers the substances in your blood to focused areas of your
        body. for some capillary networks this can dramatically
        increase the rate of accumulated flux of blood
- with knowledge of anatomy (esp. of circultory/lyphatic/ISF/CSF
  systems AND glandular systems) physiological fluid-dynamics, then
  one can sequence, time, pace and optimize their poses to trigger
  glandular release of hormones/messengers to the circulatory/etc
  systems at the right time to focus it into a specific region of the
  body
  - this requires an profound understanding of human anatomy, fluid
    dynamics, circ/lymph/isf/csf systems, and of how specific yoga
    poses influence the fluid flows of these systems
  - still, this would be a fascinating basis for many studies on how
    exactly yoga poses can alter fluid dynamics and local accumulated
    flux of circ/lymph/ISF/CSF


### Some of Kundalini Yoga's Movements Are Intended to Drive Spinal CSF Flux

- the subarachnid (...?) space has to respond to spinal motions,
  - for some kundalini movements, additional downward and posterior
    from spinal circumvection seems to be optimized by the design of
    motion

### The Effects of Specific Breathing Techniques

- [Pratiloma Ujjayi](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pratiloma_ujjayi)
 - at least partially derives its effects from:
   - (1) increased rate of inflow in one nostril with the same
     diaphram movement pulling in more air
   - (2) increased vorticity of air, resulting in turbulence and thus
     greater rates of flux across alvalolae

- [Kapalabhati (Hatha Yoga)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kapalabhati_(Hatha_Yoga))

### Qigong's Effects on Neuroelectrical Flow

- after a good session, why does the magnetic sensation emerge?
  - this sensation seems to build up over time and it's as if you can
    feel it and nudge it along while doing the qigong motions

### Accupuncture's Effects on Neuroelectrical Flow

- what effect(s) do they have on neuroelectrical flow?
- what materials have effects? why? what is the electromechanical
  effect on neural flow
- how can imagery help identification of meridiums?
  - automated identification of meridiums from CAT/MRI/imagery?
    - the meridiums do not likely not physical
    - instead may represent some derivative phenomenon that only
      emerges a direct measure
