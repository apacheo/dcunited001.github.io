# [Illuminati: The Anti-Santa](#)

The illuminati is like the Anti-Santa. Nope, the Anti-Santa is not
Jesus and you're going to wish it was.

<a name="" />

### [What if Santa Clause Snuck In Your House, Stole All Your Cookies and Set Your House on Fire?](#what-if-santa)

Why call them the Anti-Santi? You start off believing they're not
real, but once you become about 30 years old, it's impossible to not
believe in them if you're not clueless. When you believe in them, if
you're good, they being you lots of coal. If you're real bad, they'll
bring you presents and then use your sins to destroy you later. They
don't come down your chimney, they sneak in your house and close the
flue, but only if you're worth the effort to cover their tracks. The
Illuminati almost never directly does *anything* because invisibility
is paramount: you can fight what you believe exists.

#### Cookies? So You Can Gaslight Me? Do I Look Like Hansel?

![Ain't Nobody Got Time For That]()

There is no one group though, why is partially why it's so easy to
forget they couldn't possibly not exist. The Illuminati is more of a
manifestation of evil that projects itself into the world through the
collective unconscious exigencies of the nature of power combined with
certain aspects of the human condition.

Furthermore, if you're trapped with the false paradigm of metaphysics
that ascends from the material, you can never actually believe they
exist, rationally, which is why that false paradigm is soo convenient
to the Illuminati. This is partially why western cultures will often
present the opposite paradigm as heresy: because if you believe in
idealistic metaphysics, you actually can see what is happening around
you. If you don't, you're simply a powerless consumer feeding the
rich. This is yet another reason why Marxism is precisely its own
antithesis.  Marxism is not liberating, it is enslaving.

Idealistic metaphysics has its own problems, but new age voodoo is
easy enough to dismiss with a healthy dose of rationalism.

### [Who the Illuminati And Why Are They Such Assholes,
Anyways?](#who-is-the-illuminati-and-why-are-they-such-assholes-anyways)

So ... No, the Illuminati is not one group and that's worse! because
you can't so easily destroy them without either becoming them or
having another group swoop in to fill in the power vacuum. if you
don't accept this, you have no business trying to fight them because
you'll probably just make things worse.

#### The Singularity as Lavos, Meaning Fire, A Demonic Transplanar Entity Which Destroys the World in 1999

> Magus Summoning Lavos, Only To Have Deluded Himself About His Power
> To Destroy It.

![Magus Summoning Lavos](/img/posts)

The Illuminati, in is various incarnations, has been destroyed time
and time again, only to be reborn. They view themselves as necessary
evil *and they hate themselves for it*. That's important to rememeber,
since these psychotic assholes view love and hate to be identical
phenomena, essentially. They don't play fair and they push against
themselves to make themselves stronger, viewing the strongest, most
pure, most cunning as being the rightful de facto leaders in their own
invisible, decentralized power structures.

### [How Can Pindar Lead an Anonymous, Decentralized Group Of Cigar-Smoking Men?]()

Why is "Pindar" their leader? Because Pindar's vision and authenticity
is unparalleled. They are constantly looking for the person that has
what they do not. Pindar is not a single person, per se. Pindar only
derives his authority from his resistance to their flame, but they do
not know who Pindar is because they are looking for the person who can
see what they do not. And the Illuminati have meticulously crafted
mechanisms for ensuring the properly networked architecture of
society, all decentralized and autonomous. It is outlined similarly to
the sheaf and the reaper, the merchant of souls.

So, they cannot recognize him, but because they seek to so tightly
control the prevalence narratives, myths and especially history, they
hate this person. He is the blinding one who tells stories they cannot
understand or writes truths which cannot so easily be perceived. They
hate him, but they need him because he can see what they cannot -- yet
a person like this can never be given power in their understanding of
the world.

# [What Was The Sword in the Stone?](#the-sword-in-the-stone)

The illuminati have crafted myth and legend, narratives of heroes
which are meant to play out generation after generation, that function
to establish filters that cause the virtuous, righteous and
intelligent to sift higher into society, so that their society is as
strong as possible. The sword in the stone is such a myth, probably
crafted by Merlin -- or the unknown historical Merlin.





- Mention Aika-chan?
- why does this have to focus on the Rothschilds? it's really not
  about that.

- maybe use this title for another post: Semioteleological Revolution:
  A Sociophysical Phase Change

- she just had to do it. she went and gots #Teel #Heir. the
  #Rothschild's track those things down and use them mercilessly.

![Teal Hair Anime Girl - "tee-ru"]()

- i don't know any of this is actually Rothschild's fault #LOL
  - it's so easy to blam things on powerful people because ... well
    obviously "they had the power to stop it, but didn't, right?" not
    everyone has Rothschild-level problems, but shit that's what i'd
    do if I weren't me

I *almost* went to one of these sessions in Boulder, CO, but my
manager was such a dick that day, i totally forgot about it. the
#AlexanderMethod is a metaphor.

fortunately, i was smart enough to have already understood the method
as a metaphor for "limb" control. in #ElfenLied, psychics with phantom
limbs are tightly controlled. these are incredibly powerful beings
tormented by experimentation & never released.

### メードのデートスル

![](/img/posts/)

i'm not saying there's a connection b/w me, #Boulder & the
#Rothschild's. just that my manager was the most insufferable asshole
i've ever met, like he was Salaryman Stalin. anyways: no point in
fighting über-powerful people, unless you're sadomasochistic.

![Tanya the Evil]()


however, every body has a brain (mother brain)

#### メトロイド =~ [Matroid]()


If i were the Rothschild's i would read the "crazy" *literal* treatise
written by this poor insufferable *schizophrenic* because it was laid
out with a very clear understanding of their own philosophies and
methods.

[Treatise on entity and agency]()




apparently überpowerful people (not the Rothschild's, duh) have an
unnatural phobia of illicit philosophy. more than anything else, they
are scared of people who think in new and different ways because
PEOPLE WHO ARE DIFFERENT CAN'T BE PREDICTED.

thus, sociologically constrain the typology & metatypological aspects
of psychology -- perhaps by introducing artificial belief systems,
however contemptuously you may hold them -- & people become like
special dolls with meta/types imbued onto them via #Alchemy
#ManakinSkywalker

### Dark Ruler

![Just Dark Ruler]()


There's hardly anything unique about this process. It has been
reinstantiated & reiterated & combinated through the ages.
Information Warfare is competitive Symbology where the victors
understand the evolutionary dynamics & actually had the
social/financial resources to play.

what generally überpowerful #PPL cannot stand is someone who
encourages #PEOPLE to think in unpredictable ways. this vastly expands
the sociophysical gamespace. they already have control. why do they
need you? this applies to whatever group your conspiracy theory of
choice blames

you might say they view themselves as #Reapers guarding over #COVERS
of sociophysical spaces, who manage cities, states, regions, groups &
ideas as ppl that manage #SHEAVES, in both the #Teleological sense AND
the #Mathematical sense, which begs some pretty interesting questions

#### The Ironically Void Imagery of Communism In An Era of Automation

![Hammer and Sickle]()

these same ppl are relieved that humanity is becoming weak and more
predictable, even though to society at large, technology appears to be
doing the opposite. that is false: humanity is becoming weaker than
ever before bc we are losing the ability to semeoteleologically
reproduce.

"semioteleological" what does that word even mean? i invented it. i
checked. i have screenshots from google proving that no other person
EVER thought to use that word because no one has thought of
metatypological aspects of sociology so methodologically.

it perfectly describes why symbols whose meaning was so obvious for so
long have suddenly and nearly completely lost all their relevance to
humanity. thus, we are becoming completely disconnected from the myths
which helped inculcate the values systems via teleology.

we *think* that technology and science are all we need, but we are
wrong. we think that we no longer need religion or myth, but we are
sooo wrong. we have never needed it more.

#### Steel that word, assholes. I dare you.

![Teal Girl]()

i never said i couldn't be wrong about the people who occupy ivory
towers, but some of them need to be brought down. i don't know who is
responsible for this, but if *you* don't pay for *this*, how can we
expect *anyone* to pay for their crimes in the future?

- The problem here is that every group who promises revolution ends up
  being the same as those they quelled.
  - it's par for the course, at best. after considering the social
    carnage accompanying revolution, it just doesn't leave you with
    much ground to stand on.

![Robespierre and a Guillotine]()

- why is it different this time?

- Divine Right vs. the mandate of heaven

#### Expound Notes from "The Spear of Destiny and Splicing Families" ?



#### Dynasties

- three families close to the japanese emperor for hundreds of years
  - how this served the best interests of the japanese culture
    - before, during and after the time of Nobunaga
  - the emporer had the best interests of the state and the people in
    mind. to serve him was to serve the best interests of everyone.
    - but in order for the emperor and the state to serve the people,
      they had to be connected to the people.
    - over the course of generations, those close to the emperor, the
      families closest to his estate and to the government could
      "move" closer to the emperor by proving themselves
      - this is how it worked with most if not all monarchies, but
        it's interesting how well it worked in Japan, since that
        monarchy has lasted so long. It also lasted a very long time
        in Iran, so it'd be equally interesting to explore there.
      - this dynamic of moving closer and further from the monarch by
        having one's service/character assessed seems to have resulted
        in the system being architected around this.
        - japan also had very tight control of their culture. being
          east-most and geographically separate, they had less inward
          informational sociophysical flux than most, so this made it
          slightly easier to do so.
        - (it seems that this tight control of culture can be seen in
          Shinto, which is a religion that's not meant for people
          outside of japan AFAIK)
      - further, idealistic metaphysics is encoded into their
        language, grammar and thus culture. (see the particle "no")
        - this may cause the Japanese people to think about things
          differently, especially when compared to cultures speaking
          western languages, where there is so much emphasis on
          quantity, possession and the material.
          - i'm not saying one is better than the other...

# Fighting with shadows

- your enemy will be ruthless & destroy you immediately
- learn to dance with them, you're going to need it.
- wear your scars proudly.
- they will have a weapon that they will never let go of. it's not a
  fair fight. it never was. do not allow your space to become choked
  out: you need air, water, fire. you need people. you need food.
- when that one doesn't work, they have plenty more you've never
  seen. enjoy each and every one you get the chance to see because
  each one is special. some are never meant to be seen ... for long.
  - story of the house from "The Ancient Magus Bride"
  - some people never leave. you get to take one thing home with you.
    i took them all and made new ones.
  - the longer that you withstand baptism by fire without dying, the
    more of these you bring home with you.
- make them grab the weapon they didn't intend to use. your weapon is
  the way itself.
- bait them into breaking their precious things
- grab their eyes with your fearless gaze & never let go
- when they are certain you'll strike, feint instead
- be ready to fight with shadows
- when they pull you into the hall of mirrors, you're fighting shadows of yourself that do not exist
- destroy their images. ALL of them
- when you cannot lose, slay them by pushing them into their own
  weapon: *THE ONE THEY NEVER INTENDED TO EXIST*
- know your enemy.
- in your victory, do not become your enemy, in who they were or are
  or in who you were or have become

- path of least resistance?
