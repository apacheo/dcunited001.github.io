- she just had to do it. she went and gots #Teel #Heir. the
  #Rothschild's track those things down and use them mercilessly.

i don't know any of this is actually Rothschild's fault #LOL

it's so easy to blam things on powerful people because ... well
obviously "they had the power to stop it, but didn't, right?"

not everyone has #Rothschild-level problems, but shit that's what i'd
do if i weren't me


i *almost* went to one of these sessions in Boulder, CO, but my
manager was such a dick that day, i totally forgot about it. the
#AlexanderMethod is a metaphor.

fortunately, i was smart enough to have already understood the method
as a metaphor for "limb" control. in #ElfenLied, psychics with phantom
limbs are tightly controlled. these are incredibly powerful beings
tormented by experimentation & never released.



i'm not saying there's a connection b/w me, #Boulder & the
#Rothschild's. just that my manager was the most insufferable asshole
i've ever met, like Salaryman Stalin.

anyways: no point in fighting Ã¼ber-powerful people, unless you're
sadomasochistic
