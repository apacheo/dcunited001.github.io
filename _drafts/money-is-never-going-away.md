One frequently cited component of marxist rhetoric that I cannot stand
is the notion that we can simply do away with money. It's an insane
and deluded argument that marxists find themselves overly dependent
on. The world would be a better place if this idea just went away. I'm
not trying to be mean. Just realistic.

The notion that we could have a society without money is bizarre, yet
I hear it all the time. No man is an island and no economy is an
island. Even if your economy has no concept of money, it still needs
to trade with other people and other economies.

What is money? Yes, money is an abstraction; it’s a virtual commodity
that stands as a placeholder for truly valuable commodities. But what
is money? What is its essential role in society?

Money represents society’s ability to quantify resources and trade. It
is essential to quantification of commerce and of needs for human
life. You cannot have a well-functioning society without money. As
technology progresses in the 21st century, we will find that the
ultimate resource to quantify is energy. Accumulated energy is the
potential to do work, in the physical world and the informational
realm. Energy will replace money, but it is still something that needs
to be quantified and accumulated. There is no 22nd century society
without a need for quantification of resources and/or
energy. Therefore, society will always need something like money.

- renewable energy, cryptocurrency currency mining and data flows
  - e.g. "canadians mining bitcoin in Romania" (actual story)
  - in some cases, it may be more efficient (or profitable) to use
    excess renewables to mine cryptocurrency or facillitate ethereum
    operations than to store/transport it
    - this might give rise to novel types of financial flows that
      could be bundled as assets/derivatives
      - you're essentially betting that crypto activity will be more
        profitable (now or in futures) than selling/storing the
        electricity
      - eventually, investments could be bundled or facilitated as
        novel types of crypto futures (or other derivatives)
        - these differ starkly from the "bitcoin futures" of today
    - it also depends on your capacity to store energy
      - if you run out of local energy storage or if energy transfer
        infrastructure is overloaded/disrupted, then the best option
        is almost always crypto mining or ethereum
      - this could lead to shady finance schemes never before seen
        - discouraging/manipulating architecture & development of
          storage/infrastructure in countries across the world
          - e.g. if there is less, generally, than it's easier to
            influence to short the derivatives mentioned above
