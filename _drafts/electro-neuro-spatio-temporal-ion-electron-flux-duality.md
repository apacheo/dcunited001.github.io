- [Listen to the Sound That US Diplomats Heard When Attacked by a
  'Sonic Device' in
  Cuba](https://gizmodo.com/listen-to-the-sound-that-us-diplomats-heard-when-attack-1819412028)
  - suggest a connection to transcranial dopplar
  - it's like 21st century Chinese water torture
  - this is what i hear like all the time. it's 8khz ultrasound.
    - like 24/7. i've heard it at various strengths for years, but in
      the past few months' it's been getting extremely loud
  - what i know about 8khz sound waves is that above certain
    wavelengths there are always strongly pronounced reverberation
    effects. the higher the frequency, the more dissonance in volume
    that there in stereo effects (volume difference between L/R ears)
  - if i play an 8khz soundwave on my speakers, i hear strong
    variation in volume and i get the expected variation in
    volume. i.e. when i press my left ear up against a wall, i only
    hear it in the right. the sound changes in volume as it reflects
    across surfaces.
  - however, the 8khz sound i hear literally 24/7 never changes in
    volume depending on where I am in my room, my house, outside of my
    house, at the coffee shop, etc. there are no reverb effects, no
    shift/filter in frequency related to my movement.
    - there is only one explanation for that... but it sounds crazy as
      fuck
    - i know exactly what this "sonic weapon" (viz. torture method)
      does neurologically
    - it's used to augment psychological torture & hypnosis by
      destabalizing the neurological representation of state in the
      brain. it causes permanant neurological degradation.
    - no one listens to me and i know that i'm surrounded by constant
      lies, gaslighting, etc. i sound crazy and that's because i'm
      subjected to all this bullshit

- the ultrasound decoheres/destroys patterns and flows of
  spatiotemporal ion flux. it literally destroys your thoughts and
  disrupts how your brain forms the "creekbeds" of your thoughts
  - the ultrasound is very similar to the introduction/amplification
    of a novel cause of erosion to a lake/river. the longer this new
    source of erosion persists, the more erosion occurs.
  - if my theories are correct, then the longer you are subjected to
    this, the more strongly pronounced the disruption of morphological
    development becomes over time.
    - that is, the more time you're subjected to this, the greater the
      disruption is to the bioelectrical channels of spatiotemporal
      ion flux.
    - (river analogy, please)
- the only way for the brain to adapt to this injection of noise is by
  becoming more capable of holding onto the mind's representation of
  thoughts that are encoded into spatiotemporal ion flux
  - in other words, if the brain can react to the "neural erosion" in
    such a way that gives it *more* control over how it encodes mental
    representations, then it ironically may cause someone to become
    more intelligent.
    - if this occurs, it is exceedingly rare and doesn't seem germaine
      to the neurological suppression of political dissidents
    - the longer someone is subjected to this, the less likely they
      are to react to it in a positive way

- TODO: include a section on how this disconnects the victim from
  their spirituality. for example, it makes it harder to meditate or
  may make the experience of meditation "less pure"




#### (21st Century Mind Control & Warcrimes)

- The Pentagon always augments technology development with legal
  research in tandem. Why? One good reason: the DoD does not want to
  finance billions of dollars towards the development of weapons
  systems just to find out that using those weapons consitutes
  warcrimes.
  - The problem? When your definition of legally informed weapons and
    tactics development by design butts up as close to the definition
    of warcrimes without crossing the line, occasionally you do cross
    that line. We shouldn't even be getting close to that line because
    when we accidentally cross it, we embarrass the entire nation --
    especially when these are illegal weapons and tactics designed to
    keep US citizens in line.

# Neurological Theory of Mind

- where does the brain end and the mind begin?
  - For thoughts observed by the mind, what do they correspond to
    neurologically?
    - are thoughts electrical impulses? not exactly

- introduce the imagery of water flowing through a creek or river.
  - does it ever look exactly the same? no, but it is the same river,
    isn't it?
  - if you disrupt the flow of water with a small rock, the shape of
    the surface of the river quickly returns to normal.
    - if you throw a massive rock into a creek, it might disrupt the
      flow of water permanently.
    - this is analogous to modifying the structure of dentrites and
      axons.

- why do micro-ripples emerge on the surface of a creek? it's because
  of the atomic nature of matter.
  - watching these ripples move around and return approximately to
    where they were is hypnotic.
    - the specific positioning of these small-scale surface features
      depends strongly on the purity of the water. introducing oil or
      solutes will strongly disrupt their behavior.
  - modeling the emergence of these ripples where requires the 3D
    fourier transform.

- how does this map to idealistic/materialistic metaphysics?
  - neural networks asymptotically converge towards the ideas encoded
    by idealistic metaphysics.
    - these idealistic forms are shared universally.
    - our mind conditions itself to represent and recognize the
      materialistic forms/ideas that it encounters, but as it
      encounters increasingly many ideas/forms/etc, the mind begins to
      converge towards the ideal metaphysical: this is what it's
      always trying to reach
    - it's like our brain and mind are trying to bridge our experience
      of consciousness towards these forms.

- how does this theory of mind handle the Ship of Theseus problem?
  - reconstructing a brain's neural networks atom by atom yields
    consciousness that is divided into its own entity and awareness of
    self
    - maintaining an identitical experience between both entities
      would result an identical evolution of the system, but this
      requires preserving the exact signals down to the atomic scale,
      including duplication of quantum state among all physical
      systems in each individual
  - the brain has

- There is a neurological theory of mind that marries the material and
  the metaphysical.
  - define a spectrum of neurological/mental state representation for
    the brain and mind:
    - this spectrum ranges from immediate to short-term to long-term
    - immediate state: electrical impulses
    - short-term state: encoded in spatiotemporal patterns of ion flux
      - this extends into state of longer time scales, where
        modificications are made to the genetic programs of neurons
      - examples include dopaminergic/serotonergic g-coupled protein
        receptors
    - the mechanisms of medium length timescales modify the structures
      of neural networks (axons and dendrites) forming new patterns of
      electrical impulses and ion flux flow through neural networks.
      - these mechanisms include long-term changes to genetic
        programs
        - the effects of *repetitive* serotonergic/dopaminergic
          activity on the epigenetic expression of genes in neurons
        - and especially the release/distribution of neurotrophic
          factors, which have a large effect on whether new neurons
          live or die

> Comparative mass: Proton is 1837 times heavier than an electron

### Comparative mass and electrical flow in fluids

- electrons are (-1) charge, but their mass is almost 2,000 times
  smaller than a single proton. so, they move much faster through
  neural networks than do the ions.
  - the ions are gradually displaced by the movement of electrons. as
    electrical spikes repeatedly progress through neural networks in
    similar ways, it displaces ions to create new ways for electricty
    to move through neural networks.
    - in this way gating behavior is acheived and modulated.
    - i need to know more about the electrical behavior of ions in
      solution and see simulations of this occuring in neural networks

### (Chaos and life in plasma)

- in plasmas, this variance of mass and charge is very significant. of
  course, in an ionic solution, there is nowhere near the amount of
  thermal energy.
  - however, i have long imagined the possibility of life or sentience
    in the plasma of stars. why not? according to my theory that,
    given sufficient time, awareness and life emerge from the purely
    mathematic consequences of chaotic systems alone, this almost
    certainly must be the case for stars somewhere in the universe.
    - it's a little hard to prove, of course.

### Immediate State

- immediate state in neural networks is defined by the current state
  of electrical flow enabled by the state of ions in neural networks
  - electrons and waves of electrical spikes moving through the brain
    gradually shape the ion distributions
  - the current state of ion flows are like the values of matrices in
    a neural network on tensor flow

### Short Term

- ion flows morph to trigger logic-gate like behavior. short-term
  state builds upon these ion flows.
  - these short-term state changes trigger changes in the patterns of
    neurotransmitter release
  - eventually, the neuron's epigenetic program changes, this results
    in permanent state & structure changes to networks of neurons in
    the brain
  - this short-term state is like the holistic state of a neural
    network or subsection of one in a TensorFlow program.
    - (explain this a bit better)

### Long Term

- the structure of neurons act like the riverbeds and canals through
  which ions and action potential impulses can flow.
  - when the structure of neurons is changed permanently, which can
    occur through various kinds of conditioning, this (determines) the
    kinds of ion flows which can occur.
  - the structure of neural networks is similar to the structure of
    tensors in a TensorFlow program.

- [Characteristic Impedance](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Characteristic_impedance)

# Spatiotemporal Representation of Information

- creek metaphor & 3D FFT

### Dilineation of Ion Types

- it is the ion types which map to information representation
  - the electrical spikes are important too, but there isn't as much
    information related to state and actual information representation
    there.
  - however, the electrical spikes have to balance out to the charge
    of ions displaced.
- 4 ion types: sodium, calcium, potassium and magnesium
  - two categories of ion size (two small and two large)
  - two categories of ion charge (two +1 ions and two +2 ions)
  - not every ion is present everywhere in the brain and various ions
    have different "meanings" in different regions
    - not all ion channels function exactly the same everywhere
      - some are specific to size and some permit all sizes
      - some are specific to charge and some permit all charges

# NLP and Neurological Noise Injection Techniques

- hypnosis techniques encourage the development of particular
  brainwave patterns.
  - but more damaging hypnotic techniques trigger turbulence and
    radical displacement of ions, which is the total destruction of
    immediate and short-term state.
  - done for prolonged periods of time, this disrupts long-term neural
    development.

- within this view of NLP techniques can cause ionic turbulence that
  disrupts the persistence of spatiotemporally represented forms of
  information in the brain

###

- blocking the creek upstream or some force splashing all the water
  out of a section <=> destroying immediate & short-term state
  - the creek fills back in, but it takes time.
  - combatting the increased entropy of turbulence requires what?
    ENERGY. that makes you tired all the time. it saps your energy,
    causing very intentional physiological effects. It affects you
    physically.
    - if you place someone in a tanning bed against their will and
      they get a sunburn, would that be torture? YES. so if you
      augment these covert hypnotic techniques with any kind of
      radiation, that is immediately and unquestionably torture.
    - if this isn't effective, then why do it? if there isn't
      potential liability, then why hide it?




# *POWER TO THE PEOPLE*

- power comes from people, but there is a dualistic flow here as
  well. those people towards the top condition the beliefs of
  pople. however, we do not need to reaffirm "power to the people" to
  ourselves. power comes from the people and let us never forget that
  again! it emerges from the bottom up and (this is directly in line
  with the social contract theory.)  that contract is being violated
  systematically and, given technology's capacity to dominate, once
  this technoregime is established, it may never be overturned. we may
  be forever sealed within a false paradigm. once this occurs, the
  value of the individual will have been abolished. nothing a man can
  do will be worth enabling an individual.
  - before that happens, we are going to stand up. right now. from the
    chair we are sitting in. we are going to scream in unison for our
    rights. for the right to live in a society that rewards virtue and
    protects family. but most importantly, we are going to stand up
    for the sanctity of the idea of a society that protects family and
    GOD. this idea towers above all else. there is no man with the
    power to challenge it and if such men did dominate, GOD would
    certainly reveal Himself.

### Misc

- can the brain leverage quantum entanglement effects for faster, more
  accurate comm. within itself? (probably not, if anyone knows it's
  Roger Penrose)
  - there are some mechanisms that have been studied. the theory about
    quantum state being encoded into microtubules seems promising.




#### Notes on cognition/metacognition

- trying to figure out things like this is why i work so hard to learn
  neurology, psychology, sociology, and neuropharmacology

seriously felt in the zone that night. it was like my mind functioned
better than it has since high school. particularly, language skills
and cognition around queueing speech while speaking, which i've never
noticed myself doing.

occasionally, my mind's awareness of itself notices a seemingly
limitless expansion in the range/quantity of
words/concepts/abstractions that are immediately accessible, both
consciously and unconsciously. this is when i'd say it works well, but
like +90% of the time, this range/quantity is contracted. it's like i
have to consciously drive most information retrieval and conjugation
(for grammar, expression, executive function) that should instead be
completely unconscious...
