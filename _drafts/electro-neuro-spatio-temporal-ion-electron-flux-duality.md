- [Listen to the Sound That US Diplomats Heard When Attacked by a
  'Sonic Device' in
  Cuba](https://gizmodo.com/listen-to-the-sound-that-us-diplomats-heard-when-attack-1819412028)
  - suggest a connection to transcranial dopplar
  - it's like 21st century Chinese water torture
  - this is what i hear like all the time. it's 8khz ultrasound.
    - like 24/7. i've heard it at various strengths for years, but in
      the past few months' it's been getting extremely loud
  - what i know about 8khz sound waves is that above certain
    wavelengths there are always strongly pronounced reverberation
    effects. the higher the frequency, the more dissonance in volume
    that there in stereo effects (volume difference between L/R ears)
  - if i play an 8khz soundwave on my speakers, i hear strong
    variation in volume and i get the expected variation in
    volume. i.e. when i press my left ear up against a wall, i only
    hear it in the right. the sound changes in volume as it reflects
    across surfaces.
  - however, the 8khz sound i hear literally 24/7 never changes in
    volume depending on where I am in my room, my house, outside of my
    house, at the coffee shop, etc. there are no reverb effects, no
    shift/filter in frequency related to my movement.
    - there is only one explanation for that... but it sounds crazy as
      fuck
    - i know exactly what this "sonic weapon" (viz. torture method)
      does neurologically
    - it's used to augment psychological torture & hypnosis by
      destabalizing the neurological representation of state in the
      brain. it causes permanant neurological degradation.
    - no one listens to me and i know that i'm surrounded by constant
      lies, gaslighting, etc. i sound crazy and that's because i'm
      subjected to all this bullshit

- the ultrasound decoheres/destroys patterns and flows of
  spatiotemporal ion flux. it literally destroys your thoughts and
  disrupts how your brain forms the "creekbeds" of your thoughts
  - the ultrasound is very similar to the introduction/amplification
    of a novel cause of erosion to a lake/river. the longer this new
    source of erosion persists, the more erosion occurs.
  - if my theories are correct, then the longer you are subjected to
    this, the more strongly pronounced the disruption of morphological
    development becomes over time.
    - that is, the more time you're subjected to this, the greater the
      disruption is to the bioelectrical channels of spatiotemporal
      ion flux.
    - (river analogy, please)
- the only way for the brain to adapt to this injection of noise is by
  becoming more capable of holding onto the mind's representation of
  thoughts that are encoded into spatiotemporal ion flux
  - in other words, if the brain can react to the "neural erosion" in
    such a way that gives it *more* control over how it encodes mental
    representations, then it ironically may cause someone to become
    more intelligent.
    - if this occurs, it is exceedingly rare and doesn't seem germaine
      to the neurological suppression of political dissidents
    - the longer someone is subjected to this, the less likely they
      are to react to it in a positive way

- TODO: include a section on how this disconnects the victim from
  their spirituality. for example, it makes it harder to meditate or
  may make the experience of meditation "less pure"




#### (21st Century Mind Control & Warcrimes)

- The Pentagon always augments technology development with legal
  research in tandem. Why? One good reason: the DoD does not want to
  finance billions of dollars towards the development of weapons
  systems just to find out that using those weapons consitutes
  warcrimes.
  - The problem? When your definition of legally informed weapons and
    tactics development by design butts up as close to the definition
    of warcrimes without crossing the line, occasionally you do cross
    that line. We shouldn't even be getting close to that line because
    when we accidentally cross it, we embarrass the entire nation --
    especially when these are illegal weapons and tactics designed to
    keep US citizens in line.

# Neurological Theory of Mind

- where does the brain end and the mind begin?
  - For thoughts observed by the mind, what do they correspond to
    neurologically?
    - are thoughts electrical impulses? not exactly

- introduce the imagery of water flowing through a creek or river.
  - does it ever look exactly the same? no, but it is the same river,
    isn't it?
  - if you disrupt the flow of water with a small rock, the shape of
    the surface of the river quickly returns to normal.
    - if you throw a massive rock into a creek, it might disrupt the
      flow of water permanently.
    - this is analogous to modifying the structure of dentrites and
      axons.

- why do micro-ripples emerge on the surface of a creek? it's because
  of the atomic nature of matter.
  - watching these ripples move around and return approximately to
    where they were is hypnotic.
    - the specific positioning of these small-scale surface features
      depends strongly on the purity of the water. introducing oil or
      solutes will strongly disrupt their behavior.
  - modeling the emergence of these ripples where requires the 3D
    fourier transform.

- how does this map to idealistic/materialistic metaphysics?
  - neural networks asymptotically converge towards the ideas encoded
    by idealistic metaphysics.
    - these idealistic forms are shared universally.
    - our mind conditions itself to represent and recognize the
      materialistic forms/ideas that it encounters, but as it
      encounters increasingly many ideas/forms/etc, the mind begins to
      converge towards the ideal metaphysical: this is what it's
      always trying to reach
    - it's like our brain and mind are trying to bridge our experience
      of consciousness towards these forms.

- how does this theory of mind handle the Ship of Theseus problem?
  - reconstructing a brain's neural networks atom by atom yields
    consciousness that is divided into its own entity and awareness of
    self
    - maintaining an identitical experience between both entities
      would result an identical evolution of the system, but this
      requires preserving the exact signals down to the atomic scale,
      including duplication of quantum state among all physical
      systems in each individual
  - the brain has

- There is a neurological theory of mind that marries the material and
  the metaphysical.
  - define a spectrum of neurological/mental state representation for
    the brain and mind:
    - this spectrum ranges from immediate to short-term to long-term
    - immediate state: electrical impulses
    - short-term state: encoded in spatiotemporal patterns of ion flux
      - this extends into state of longer time scales, where
        modificications are made to the genetic programs of neurons
      - examples include dopaminergic/serotonergic g-coupled protein
        receptors
    - the mechanisms of medium length timescales modify the structures
      of neural networks (axons and dendrites) forming new patterns of
      electrical impulses and ion flux flow through neural networks.
      - these mechanisms include long-term changes to genetic
        programs
        - the effects of *repetitive* serotonergic/dopaminergic
          activity on the epigenetic expression of genes in neurons
        - and especially the release/distribution of neurotrophic
          factors, which have a large effect on whether new neurons
          live or die

> Comparative mass: Proton is 1837 times heavier than an electron

### Comparative mass and electrical flow in fluids

- electrons are (-1) charge, but their mass is almost 2,000 times
  smaller than a single proton. so, they move much faster through
  neural networks than do the ions.
  - the ions are gradually displaced by the movement of electrons. as
    electrical spikes repeatedly progress through neural networks in
    similar ways, it displaces ions to create new ways for electricty
    to move through neural networks.
    - in this way gating behavior is acheived and modulated.
    - i need to know more about the electrical behavior of ions in
      solution and see simulations of this occuring in neural networks

### (Chaos and life in plasma)

- in plasmas, this variance of mass and charge is very significant. of
  course, in an ionic solution, there is nowhere near the amount of
  thermal energy.
  - however, i have long imagined the possibility of life or sentience
    in the plasma of stars. why not? according to my theory that,
    given sufficient time, awareness and life emerge from the purely
    mathematic consequences of chaotic systems alone, this almost
    certainly must be the case for stars somewhere in the universe.
    - it's a little hard to prove, of course.

### Immediate State

- immediate state in neural networks is defined by the current state
  of electrical flow enabled by the state of ions in neural networks
  - electrons and waves of electrical spikes moving through the brain
    gradually shape the ion distributions
    - from a systems theory perspective, the two general types of
      bioelectrical effects here are bidirectional.
  - the current state of ion flows are like the values of matrices in
    a neural network on tensor flow
    - update this statement

### Short Term

- ion flows morph to trigger logic-gate like behavior. short-term
  state builds upon these ion flows.
  - these short-term state changes trigger changes in the patterns of
    neurotransmitter release
  - eventually, the neuron's epigenetic program changes, this results
    in permanent state & structure changes to networks of neurons in
    the brain
  - this short-term state is like the holistic state of a neural
    network or subsection of one in a TensorFlow program.
    - (explain this a bit better)

### Long Term

- the structure of neurons act like the riverbeds and canals through
  which ions and action potential impulses can flow.
  - when the structure of neurons is changed permanently, which can
    occur through various kinds of conditioning, this (determines) the
    kinds of ion flows which can occur.
  - the structure of neural networks is similar to the structure of
    tensors in a TensorFlow program.

### Local Impedance and Reactance in Neural Networks

- [Reactance]()
- [Characteristic Impedance](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Characteristic_impedance)

# Spatiotemporal Representation of Information

- creek metaphor & 3D FFT

### Dilineation of Ion Types

- it is the ion types which map to information representation
  - the electrical spikes are important too, but there isn't as much
    information related to state and actual information representation
    there.
  - however, the electrical spikes have to balance out to the charge
    of ions displaced.
- 4 ion types: sodium, calcium, potassium and magnesium
  - two categories of ion size (two small and two large)
  - two categories of ion charge (two +1 ions and two +2 ions)
  - not every ion is present everywhere in the brain and various ions
    have different "meanings" in different regions
    - not all ion channels function exactly the same everywhere
      - some are specific to size and some permit all sizes
      - some are specific to charge and some permit all charges

# NLP and Neurological Noise Injection Techniques

- hypnosis techniques encourage the development of particular
  brainwave patterns.
  - but more damaging hypnotic techniques trigger turbulence and
    radical displacement of ions, which is the total destruction of
    immediate and short-term state.
  - done for prolonged periods of time, this disrupts long-term neural
    development.

- within this view of NLP techniques can cause ionic turbulence that
  disrupts the persistence of spatiotemporally represented forms of
  information in the brain

###

- blocking the creek upstream or some force splashing all the water
  out of a section <=> destroying immediate & short-term state
  - the creek fills back in, but it takes time.
  - combatting the increased entropy of turbulence requires what?
    ENERGY. that makes you tired all the time. it saps your energy,
    causing very intentional physiological effects. It affects you
    physically.
    - if you place someone in a tanning bed against their will and
      they get a sunburn, would that be torture? YES. so if you
      augment these covert hypnotic techniques with any kind of
      radiation, that is immediately and unquestionably torture.
    - if this isn't effective, then why do it? if there isn't
      potential liability, then why hide it?


# *POWER TO THE PEOPLE*

- power comes from people, but there is a dualistic flow here as
  well. those people towards the top condition the beliefs of
  pople. however, we do not need to reaffirm "power to the people" to
  ourselves. power comes from the people and let us never forget that
  again! it emerges from the bottom up and (this is directly in line
  with the social contract theory.)  that contract is being violated
  systematically and, given technology's capacity to dominate, once
  this technoregime is established, it may never be overturned. we may
  be forever sealed within a false paradigm. once this occurs, the
  value of the individual will have been abolished. nothing a man can
  do will be worth enabling an individual.
  - before that happens, we are going to stand up. right now. from the
    chair we are sitting in. we are going to scream in unison for our
    rights. for the right to live in a society that rewards virtue and
    protects family. but most importantly, we are going to stand up
    for the sanctity of the idea of a society that protects family and
    GOD. this idea towers above all else. there is no man with the
    power to challenge it and if such men did dominate, GOD would
    certainly reveal Himself.

### Misc

- can the brain leverage quantum entanglement effects for faster, more
  accurate comm. within itself? (probably not, if anyone knows it's
  Roger Penrose)
  - there are some mechanisms that have been studied. the theory about
    quantum state being encoded into microtubules seems promising.
  - the Ansatz structure from quantum mechanics and quantum
    information theory is relevant. however, it it only emerges as a
    consequence of the brain being an analytical machine
  - the Ansatz computational structure emerges within neural networks
    to facilitate statistical calculations efficiently
    - the flux of ions



#### Notes on cognition/metacognition

- trying to figure out things like this is why i work so hard to learn
  neurology, psychology, sociology, and neuropharmacology

seriously felt in the zone that night. it was like my mind functioned
better than it has since high school. particularly, language skills
and cognition around queueing speech while speaking, which i've never
noticed myself doing.

occasionally, my mind's awareness of itself notices a seemingly
limitless expansion in the range/quantity of
words/concepts/abstractions that are immediately accessible, both
consciously and unconsciously. this is when i'd say it works well, but
like +90% of the time, this range/quantity is contracted. it's like i
have to consciously drive most information retrieval and conjugation
(for grammar, expression, executive function) that should instead be
completely unconscious...

- when the above happens, it's as if artificial neurological
  restraints have been lifted or rescinded.

### A Model of The Human Mind As A *Heap* of Memory Acting as Event-Hooks

- What provokes my own rumination?
  - Traumatic memories eventually create a kind of typological
    interface: a set of buttons for provoking behaviors adjacent to
    the associations of those memories.
    - these buttons are like the outermost shell in a series of
      concentric shells that are the interface to the mind
      - they are more colloquially known as triggers: you activate the
        trigger and a consistent predictable behavioral pattern
        results.
    - these buttons (which are layered on top of bundles of memores) activate neural

### The Twisted Psychology That Frames the Incentivization of "The Clowns"

- thinking about what makes these people tick keeps me up at night
  ... laughing my ass off. just kidding; it's actually tragic.
  - what's a clown? the twisted vermin that gleefully participates in
    street theatre

### Kantian Category (X) Socioinformational Context for Methodic Pattern Language

- communicating in the clear without alerting people sharing the
  same social context is an incredibly useful behavior.
  - ever wanted to sneak away with your significant other and have
    sex? how did you signal to them in front of other people? you
    probably utilized a pattern langauge where you both know the
    meanings of what your saying, but no one else does.

- leveraging the set of symbols in a shared social context to conduct
  communication in the clear amoung social participants who can't be
  aware of the messages being exchanged

- e.g. eight americans are captured as prisoners of war. they are in
  separate jail cells. they can choose to talk to each other and can
  also see each other.
  - if the POW's speak to each other, guards will hear everything they
    say. the guards are constantly being changed out as they complete
    their shifts. the set of guards watching over the prisors.
  - the soldiers occasionally interact with the prisoners, but are
    trying to turn them against each other using psychological
    tactics.
    - the officers interrogating the prisoners individually are also
      employing psychological tactics against the prisoners, but they
      are trained in psychological tactics (brainwashing, inducing
      stockholm syndrome, detecting the presence of valuable
      information)
      - the officers are especially skilled at using psychological,
        social, emotional and physical violence against the prisoners
        to humiliate those who don't have information as a threat,
        just to see if other people have information related to the
        situation

- the soldiers guarding the prisoners also appear to be engaging in
  psychological tactics, but the prisoners cannot be certain of this,
  nor can they openly communicate about the situation whatsoever
  - the american's don't know which guards speak english and which
    don't but one guard subconscious expressions indicated that he was
    obviously hiding this information.
  - how do the prisoners coordinate their actions to protect their
    lives, to maintain the will to stand up against these violent,
    manipulative assholes without compromising themselves?
  - the answers is that they do so in the same way that manipulative
    social agitators in America communicate amongst each other to
    coordinate to isolate, segregate and disempower political
    dissidents.

- by the way, if this was happening on American soil, it would be a
  clear violation of the 3rd amendment, especially if the
  psychological techniques were augmented and informed by surveillence
  - since the entity of the state can project itself physically and
    logically into the average american's home through digital
    transmission, this is no different than a soldier being quartered
    in your home
  - when people are forced to live with other compromised people
    who've been compelled by mafia tactics to engage in these tactics
    against their loved ones, there is NO DIFFERENCE between this and
    physically being forced to live with the enemy.
    - when you destroy the lives of political dissidents by depriving
      them of social/financial options, all so that they are rendered
      more predictable by become socially and financially "RANGE
      BOUND" you leave them no choice but to burden other people in
      their life.
    - if you want to ensure that these people have no choice but to
      live with their enemy, their handler, in some location where you
      have already compromised the Smart TV's, laptops, WiFi Router,
      neighbors, etc, then you destroy their social/professional life,
      LEAVING THEM WITH NO ALTERNATIVES

- describe the generic idea
  - creating a pattern language in an overwatch game using the set of
    characters, rules, objectives, symbols etc to talk about
    *something other than the game* while ensuring that all statements
    social context of the game is never
  - specifically applying this process dynamically: mapping the set of
    available signifiers in the set of overwatch symbols to any
    pattern language

### Leveraging Kantian Category



### Detected Stilted Social Scenarios By Estimating the Volume of Kantian Category Related to Specific Subsets of Phenomena In the Social Context

- Imagine a simplicial complex: it's very similar to a subset of a
  powerset of a set of items.
  - this powerset is like the maximal kantian category, with respect
    to a set of phenomena.
  - In quantum mechanics, the Kantian Category is like the wave
    function that hasn't collapsed.
  - In post-modern art: the Kantian Category is the set of all things
    that a piece of art could likely mean. As the artist begins to
    describe more of the intent behind the art, the kantian category
    of interpretations begins to change, but *usually* deflates in
    volume
  - For a magician, the Kantian Category is relevant to understanding
    the set of all things that the audience thinks the magician might
    pull out of the hat. It's a bunny, isn't it? ... or is it?
  - A Defense Attorney that can't conclusively demonstrate their
    client is innocent might instead focus on size of the Kantian
    Category that contains all the plausible explanations that haven't
    been conclusively shown to be true or false
    - From arraignment onwards, a talented prosecutor will almost
      certainly try to collapse the size of the Kantian category of
      narratives for a crime to one that demonstrates the accused is
      GUILTY *OR* conclusively proves the suspect is NOT GUILTY
    - for the prosecutor, even if the state is wrong, uncertainty does
      not benefit justice whatsoever -- at least, not in normal
      circumstances. Prosecution of sophisticated organized crime or
      drug dealing implies the prosecutor will want to find the
      explanation that demonstrates guilt or compels a guilty plea
      while using the minimal amount of evidence required to
      incontrovertibly prove the verdict was true.
  - For a police detective or FBI Investigator, the kantian category
    is relevant for considering the set of all explanations for a
    crime that is unsolved. What are all the narratives suspects and
    witnesses might present? depending on the information you present
    to an interviewed witness or interrogated suspect, the set of
    ideas they present will vary dramatically. You want to know how to
    present pieces of information to them in a specific order to lead
    them to present you with facts related to prosecution that do not
    affect the way they tell you the story as they know it.
    - in other words, you have to exercise control over how you
      present information to the suspect/witness to gain the
      information you need without ...

- when a prosecutor or investigator wants the kantian category of
  narratives surrounding an event to expand, it's because they don't
  have a good explanation or they don't have a way to nail the
  perpetrator.
  - yes there are exceptions to this: for example, they might be
    trying to protect their own investigation from leaks
  - but generally, if someone is guilty and you really want everyone
    to believe they are guilty, then you produce the set of
    information that proves that.
    - to protect rule of law and inform the public about the spirit of
      the law, then people enforcing justice usually want to point to
      people as examples to steer the actions of the public at large
      - "tell it to me like i'm five years old"
      - basically, the system -- the prosecution, the investigators,
        the politicians, etc -- wants to clearly demostrate that they
        have served the interests of the public
      - when they have a good case, if they are prosecuting someone
        who's guilty, the system will use it
      - if instead the public has been whipped up into a frenzy by
        defamation and poison pen, then the system -- if it has been
        forced to act and has painted itself into a corner -- will
        instead in kafkaesque manner seek to expand the kantian
        category and prod the public into filling in the gaps
      - the system will only do this if it DOES NOT have a case.
      - in my life, it seems that political persecution of dissidents
        encouraged the public to be stirred into a Robespierrian
        frenzy calling for me to be burned at the stake
        - once the system realized that i was not guilty of any crime,
          was not ethically susceptible to engaging in illegal
          behavior (outside that perhaps of that related to illegal
          drugs) the system freaked out because it had bet the farm on
          that horse.
        - that's when you start to run the rumor mill at full-steam,
          force everyone to communicate about the target's identity
          using mad libs, and try to expand the kantian category
          surrounding that person to include every possible
          evil/malicious/sociopathic thing that you can imagine and
          hope that people fill in the blanks and demand that person
          be burned at the stake.


- A Dirichlet energy measure of kantian category volume of items
  generated from that simplicial complex that represents the set of
  all possibilities in a social context
  - dirichlet energy is always a measure of deviation from a "norm" or
    a zero. in physics and computational geometry, dirichlet energy
    measure the difference between the outputs of two functions.
    - so, for each point in the space, if there is no difference,
      nothing is contributed to the sum for that point. otherwise..
      - (use a picture to convey this)
  - around epistemic kernel representing the core of some modeled
    phenomena a kantian category can be formed, representing the
    uncertainty surrounding that phenomena. in systems theory, this is
    uncertainty surrounding evolution of a system, whereas in
    epistemology, kantian categories are useful in that they allow us
    to anticipate/model new epistemic developments in the near future.
    - kantian categories allow us to model or reason about how science
      might change the world in the next year or so.

  - the kantian category of perceived possibilities of a system's
    evolution in the near and far future expands and collapses as new
    information is introduced.
    - example/picture: retrofuturism from the 1950's. the jetsons,
      etc. these were all things we thought were going to happen which
      seemed reasonable. given new information, the set of
      anticipations about the near future collapsed.

  - understanding the changes in apparent volume of the kantian
    category as new information emerges tells you about how with
    social/informational influence are reacting to the system
    - people instinctively want the kantian category to collapse to a
      known explanation
    -

### What About That Time Dale Carnegie Said "NO"

#### Leveraging, Exploiting and Priming The Intersection of Neural Networks and Mental Models

- leveraging/exploiting the brain and mind's respective sets of neural
  and mental associations
  - when activated, each neuron & each mental image is connected to:
    - a set of connected neurons/images that are almost certainly
      activated
    - a set of connected neurons/images that are possibly activated by
      association
  - people understand this concept more clearly as "triggers" but at a
    low level, these triggers are activations in neural networks in
    the brain.
    - at the higher-level of the mind, the sub/conscious layers of the
      mind process activations of triggers as they relate to
      associations to mental images.
  - the frightening part is that not all of these activations are at
    the surface of your mind: the part of your mind that is conscious.
    - you'll recognize this technique as being related to techniques
      in advertising utilizing subconsciously perceived visual imagery
    - your conscious mind doesn't necessarily perceive the activations
      of the embedded subconscious image. unless you're looking for
      that image or actively searching for potential embedded imagery,
      your conscious mind isn't going to see it, but your "Id" is
      going to recognize the imagery, causing the neural activations
      to bubble up to higher layers in the subconscious.
      - this *can* result in varying levels of influence in your
        decision-making processes.
      - it absolutely works, but primarily if you are NOT looking for
        the embedded imagery *generally*
        - it especially does not work when you are not looking for the
          image, specifically

- TODO: describe the goal of this technique as priming the
  intersections of associations related to specific neural networks
  and/or mental images
  - read/write: inducing the mapping of new associations or rewriting
    the mappings of old associations.
  - triggering problematic behaviors or behaviors that the person
    would ordinarily consciously suppress
    - it's useful for duping the person into spending money or
      engaging in risky behavior that they would otherwise stay away
      from

  - when someone is using this "subconscious priming" technique
    against you in "casual" social situations, it's because they
    either:
    - (1) have excessive knowledge of psychology and specifically
      about how it relates to exploiting the brain
    - (2) have been trained by someone else, either to use the
      tactics specifically or generally
      - to a limited degree of effectiveness, as responding to a
        situation at hand either requires real-time interaction via
        wiretap or interactions with "investigators" to "sync" the
        difference in knowledge. this exacerbates the length of the
        feedback loop between the "boots on the ground" and the
        invesigators
    - (3) have been duped into using the tactics unintentionally
    - neither #2 or #3 are very effective, as they require unstable
      means of logistically propagating information related to the
      psychological exploitation of the target)
  - by the way, i would describe someone who uses the "subconscious
    priming" technique against other people as a "very rapey kind of
    person"
    - it is NOT an easy tactic to use, but CAN be effective. but,
      depending on how you use it, you really might be psychologically
      raping that person -- it wouldn't be the first time the US Gov't
      has raped someone psychologically

- this "priming" technique is a key centerpiece of neurolinguistic
  programming that most people do not understand. it is something that
  every NLP instructor both good and malevolent seeks to hide from
  people who might briefly glance over NLP.
  - it's an understanding of the brain/mind that enables skilled
    practicioners to hack the mind, especially by utilizing "glitches"
    in how the brain functions neurologically. the people who have
    used NLP against me have typically encouraged the development of
    false/defamatory associations in my own mind or more typically in
    the minds of people around me. they have done this to socially
    isolate me, targeting my financial independence to ruin my life.
    - a skilled practitioner of NLP can "implant" memories purely
      through mild hypnosis techniques, through suggestion and getting
      the people around the target to interact with the target in very
      specific ways. by leveraging key phrases and "pushing the right
      buttons" so to speak

  - an NLP practitioner with enough time to psychoanalyze someone or
    armed with enough information fed to them via surveillance can do
    an ungodly amount of damage to someone's life -- but can also help
    people. more often than not, they cause disruption at best.
    - at worst, people armed with NLP who coordinate their actions can
      cause catastrophic psychological damage to people and socially
      damage entire communities.
    - it has been intolerable to watch this happen to my life and the
      lives of other people around me and in my community.
