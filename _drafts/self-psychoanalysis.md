explain defacement of my sister's art and rationale behind it


- assuming you borrow a car, this necessarily injects a dependency on
  communication and scheduling with whoever you're going to borrow the
  car from.
          - this basically pegs every transportation need you have
            with O(n) additional tasks by injecting the equivalent of
            an unnecessary abstraction into your personal logistics.
          - if you:
            - (1) inherently weak with communication via aspergers and
              social isolation
            - (2) over several years of have accumulated a bad
              relationship with the person whose car you're borrowing,
              who is absolutely not responsible for your situation,

              (practically the *only* social connection you have in
              your hollowed out 1ยบ social neighborhood)
            - (3) need social interaction to improve your life, but
              can't leave the house during the day because but
              can't network with the right people where you live
            - (5) you have made less than $7000 of disposable income
              since september 2014
          - then: you should read what i write because social physics
            is the answer to understanding all your problems.
            - you're probably only going to



==========


# main theme:

### my strongest social connections are the most toxic

my problems are socially imposed
- the statement "you are a mixture of the 5 people you spend the most
  time with" could not be more relevant to my situation
  - except, for me, there is only one person with whom i actually
    spend a lot of time with

- the assertion that my problems are socially imposed could not be
  more true and the only way to fix my problems are by changing my
  social settings.
  - that is it. it's simple. without change to my social settings and
    social experiences, ONE CANNOT REASONABLY EXPECT FOR MY PROBLEMS
    TO CHANGE.
    - this is the sad truth, considering I basically have no where
      else to turn for help besides my family, who is the source of
      toxicity in my life.
    - they are basically drawing me in to keep me close to ensure that
      my situation never truly changes. why? to save face and that's
      it. it is solely to retroactively justify all of the other
      mistreatment in my life!

### truly random information/behavior is distinct

truly random information/behavior is distinct from tightly-coupled,
functionally relevant information/behavior.

- it is trivial to determine if someone's behavior/reactions/tactics/objectives
  are tightly-coupled to one's own. (behavior/reactions/tactics/objectives)

- a perfect storm is a random occurance ... IN NATURE! A perfect storm
  in mental health treatment IS NOT A RANDOM OCCURANCE. There is
  simply too much human involvement from so many angles.
  - One must assume it cannot be chance.

###

- similarity to solving sudoku puzzles: have to evaluate paths without
  being sure of the coherence of their truth values
  - i.e. there are no simple tactics where one can be sure that one
    move advances the solution
- similarity to the Bell distribution
  - also Hardy distribution
  - refer to the Simon Institute lectures
- liar's paradoxes, etc.

### true change springs from the intention of change

true, long-term, positive change will be the result of positive
intention in the hearts of those around me.
- if i am surrounded by people who harbor negativity in their hearts,
  my situation will not change

# No Talk of My Personal Goals. That subject IS TABOO.

- there is no talk of how to change my situation. THERE IS SIMPLY NO
  *REAL* DISCUSSION OF GOALS, PLANS, IDEAS, OR *ANYTHING* that will
  result in real, positive, long-term change!
  - there's no discussion of it. the lack of discussion is an
    indication that no one around me harbors positive intent for my
    life in their hearts.
    - you don't hear discussion related to the expression of a desire
      for real change because the desire for real, positive change
      *SIMPLY DOES NOT EXIST!*
  - this is why my mom, my brother, his family, my sister, her family
    simply do not talk about my goals: *because there is no thought
    arising from the intent to support my goals!* Again, it simply
    does not exist.

I have [?] main goals in my life and these subjects just so happen to
be TABOO at the dinner-table. As in: it is strictly VERBOTEN to
discuss any of my life goals, espcially in front of our younger, more
impressionable family members, WHO ARE NEVER TO LOOK UP TO ME. **GOD,
NO!** *BECAUSE MY FATE HAS ALREADY BEEN DECIDED!!*

#### &#x2605; Become as intelligent as I can. Learn as much as I can.

- via coursera, college, whatever

#### &#x2605; Learn skills that increase my employability, life experience and personal utility

- if my employability was a concern, my family would seek to act in
  ways that sets employability as a goal
  - they don't. my mom actively acts to subversively prevent me from
    becoming more employable
  - my brother doesn't enable me with opportunities for expanding my
    skillset. for example, he wouldn't let me work on a digital
    signage solution for the skating rink.
    - I SIMPLY WAS NOT ALLOWED! NOT ALOUD!
    - Again, this would be a project that every person who worked at
      the skate center would understand I completed. And every
      customer would use.
    - a cheap, raspberry-pi digital signage solution would demonstrate
      my skills and MAKE ME MORE EMPLOYABLE.
      - however, it is their goal to prevent me from achieving my
        goals
      - AGAIN, IT IS THEIR GOAL TO ACTIVELY, BUT SUBVERSIVELY PREVENT
        ME FROM ACHIEVING MY OWN GOALS!!
        - they absolutely don't want to get caught doing so -- because
          dear God that would be disgusting wouldn't it?
        - active, subversive sabotage from one's own family?!
          - that is unthinkable


  - when I take classes on coursera or when I'm working on
    a project,

#### &#x2605; Launch a Startup or App to become an Angel Investor

- never engouraged. always discouraged.
- when I talk about a startup or busines

#### &#x2605; Become the best programmer that I could be

- again, like my other goals and strategies to attain them, it's never
  encouraged & always discouraged.
  - no discussion about my skillset and no discussion about
    previous/current projects
  - they never encouraged me to involve my nieces or nephews in a
    project.
    - even though I have boundless experience which would be
      invaluable to share.

#### &#X2605; Develop 3D Visual & Audiovisual Art after developing 3D Rendering Engine skills

- no recognition of why this would be an important goal to work
  towards.
- again, never encouraged & always discouraged.
- never discussed with extended family members. never discussed with
  friends. they NEVER seek to understand what I'm working on
  - BUT THEY ARE SO QUICK TO DISCOURAGE ME FROM WORKING ON IT
  - without ever realistically considering the profitability in
    finances, skill or experience in such projects.

#### &#x2605; Write as much as I possibly can until I have nothing left to write (i have a decade's worth of material)

- i have about 50,000 words of content that is in draft form in my
  sources branch.
  - not just onlined, but mostly completed and ready to publish
- i have another 100k words of content that is in outline form in my
  sources branch.
- i have about 300k words of content in my
- i have about 300k words of fiction content in pre-outline form

to write in my drafts folder
  on the sources


#### &#x2605; Work with an editor to monetize my writing by publishing books

- i have at least two non-fiction books I could write AND SELL

#### &#x2605; Learn Japanese (and other languages, but JP first)



#### &#x2605; Live in Japan (eventually)


### These are all realistic goals. Each and every one of them.

If i were to fail with one of them, I could exceed at another.


#### &#x2605; Stake my claim on immortality in the pages of history as a 21st Century Einstein.

Maybe this particular goal seems unrealistic. However, I can cite so
much evidence that would imply that I AM A 21ST CENTURY EINSTEIN. Yeh,
I'm about to make that argument.

Yet, I'm losing my claim to evidence supporting such a dramatic
conclusion: and this is what my family is threatening to ruin. They
are not just ruining my life. They are not just exacerbating my
personal prognosis.  They are preventing me from staking that claim:
that I am a 21st century Einstein.

How are they doing so? By disrupting my work and preventing me from
publishing information in a timely fashion.  Publishing such
information would allow me to stake my claim to high-level
developments, such as:

#### &#x2605: A Unified model for metanomics, based on probabilistic programming

EINSTEIN! Right here, in and of itself. This single theory implies
21st Century Einstein. And my family? They don't want to help me. They
want to prevent me from accomplishing this. And staking my claim to
such academic developments in a timely fashion.

All I have to do is publish the "Metanomics" series, which outlined
and partially drafted.

#### &#x2605: Ephemeral Theory of Linguistic Evolution during Ice Age, emphasizing self-organizing adherence to collective un/consciousness

In its current form, this idea is an interesting concept for a
fantasy/sci-fi series, at most. I haven't even personally verified
that this theory is distinguished from other theories of post-LGM
linguistic development. However, it should be trivial to develop
further and is at least an interesting theory.

Regardless, even presenting a summerization of this theory requires an
understanding of linguistics, anthropology, pre-history, sociology
and...


# Realistic Goals for Getting Myself Out of this situation

# How else can i tell that my family does not have good intentions

I am at the shit end of set of very emotionally abusive relationships
with my family. The strongest social & emotional relationships I have
are toxic, corrosive, and detrimental to my mental health. They
exacerbate my emotional pain. They demonstrate willful, knowledgable
adherence to "treatment plan" or a set of correlated behaviors which
could only make someone with my diagnoses worse!!

That's what is so frustrating: not only do the people closest to me
act to ignore my pain and my PTSD/Asperger's, they are acting in a way
that implies that they are willfully and knowledgably complicit in
adhering to tactics which could only make my prognosis worse. The only
reason mental health practicioners would advise my family to act in
such a way is to exacerbate underlying causes related to my
diagnosis!! So, if they are working with someone else, that someone
else is very aware of my true diagnoses and has methodically relayed
information to my family TO EXACERBATE THESE PROBLEMS! TO MAKE MY
SITUATION WORSE AND USE MY FAMILY TO DO EXACTLY THAT.


#### &#x2605; Lack of encouragement/discussion related to my goals

#### &#x2605; Antithetical Disposition towards my goals and people who support me

#### &#x2605; Not allowed to be a Role Model

#### &#x2605; Active Interference with Mental Health

- when I establish a relationship with a mental health practicioner

#### &#x2605; General Suppression of Communication

#### &#x2605; No Discussion of Problems

#### &#x2605; No Written Discussion of Problems

they haven't expended any time/energy on coming up with a plan for
getting me out of the house.  other than hoping that general
antipathy, guilt and shame will eventually make me hit "ROCK BOTTOM"
and that I might be motivated through sufficient
pain/fear/discomfort...
- what a loving family, amirite?

#### &#x2605; Duplicity of intent/action

- there are plenty of examples of where duplicity of intent/action
  behind my family's actions leads me to a more negative, more
  compromised disposition.
  - they will use duplicity of statements/actions to further restrict
    my available actions, but they never afford the same foresight,
    tactfulness when the outcome could be more positive for me
  - examples of how duplicity and tact can be used for positive
    results?

#### &#x2605; They Pursue Action with Detrimental Consequences Without Discussing It With Me

- my mom and family sought action in the court system to get the state to put
  me away. my mom went so far as to say she'd been sworn in to the
  court system.
  - she did so without warning me (not a good sign)



#### &#x2605; Feigning Incompetence

-


#### &#x2605; Inaction when I complain about being bullied at work



#### &#x2605; Feigning Ignorance, Generally

generally, when a family member and I argue, if I talk about my
writing, they act like they don't understand
- they don't want to understand because it confers rhetorical
  ammunition. it gives me reasons to legitimize my work, my writing,
  my position in the world.
  - if they conveyed understanding of my writing, they would have to
    admit that I'm practically an einstein and that they've been
    complicit in the psychological torture of this person.
  - so they feign ignorance of the content
    - and at the same time, they GUILT me for EXPECTING that they have
      either read or would understand
    - total BS Barney Fife Bullshit: "Well Golley David, I guess we
      just aren't fancy intellectuals like you"
    - when they never seek to understand in the first place
    - they do so and they emphasize that I should feel guilty for
      asking them to read and to understand!! WHAT THE FUCK?!

- yet they seek no action to acquire understanding
  - that is, they don't try to understand any of the content
    themselves
    - 40% of which any college educated person should understand


- why don't they try to understand? because their actions are
  motivated by attempts to

#### &#x2605; Feigning Ignorance when it comes to mental health policy/action

- my mom actively injects herself into psychiatric relationships when
  it
  - she does so without notifying me: she got comfortable with access
    to patient info and capacity to manipulate the relationship with
    Dr. Mylan

#### &#x2605; Choosing Conversation Topics which Exclude Me

- in social situations with family members, they (sister & mother)
  seek to choose conversation topics which actively exclude me and limit
  conversation topics which my draw my interest or inclusion.
  - this is really a metric of how much someone wants you included in
    any situation.
  - in positive social situations, the people you are socializing will
    choose conversation subjects which demonstrate your skills, your
    social appeal, your positive traits, allow you to assert your
    identity and allow you to develop stronger connections with
    others!
  - in situations where some participants harbor negativity and
    resentment, you may find that these people leverage the subject of
    discussion and type of interactions to:
    - those which confer strenth/influence to themselves
      - that is, they are selfish
      - they monopolize conversation, etc
      - this really can't be helped and often signifies defect of
        personality. some people just do this
    - OR: far from a simple defect of personality, they activiely
      limit your exposure to cultivate positive relationships by
      employing such tactics as monoploization of conversation, etc
  - if u experience this enough, you'll notice such simple-minded tactics:
    - monopolization of conversation,
    - restriction of topics to discussion.
  - if it's truly happening AND IS OBVIOUS
    - THEN OTHER PEOPLE WILL BEGIN TO NOTICE
    - starting with the people who know you and are aware of tension

- again, when someone uses such simple-minded, rude, social tactics
  against someone who has difficulty learning about such social
  phenomena, IT IS OBVIOUS THAT EITHER:
  - THEY ARE WILLFULLY IGNORANT OF ASPERGER'S **AT BEST!**
  - OR THEY ARE WILLFULLY USING YOUR DIAGNOSES' SOCIAL INEPTITUDE
    AGAINST YOU!!
    - HOLY FUCKING SHIT NO FUCKING WAY WHO THE FUCK WOULD DO THAT?!
    - OH!!! Oh!!!!!! YOUR FAMILY DOES THAT TO YOU?!!! YOUR FAMILY!!!??
    - LEVERAGES WHAT TO PLACE YOU IN A CONSTANT STATE OF ISOLATION AND
      DISADVANTAGE?! YOUR DIAGNOSIS OF ASPERGERS?!
    - Your
      [refrigerator mother](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Refrigerator_mother_theory)
      does what? Intentionally?

#### &#x2605; Playing Ignorant when it comes to mental health actions


#### &#x2605; They Disregard the Reality of my Chronic Depression



#### &#x2605; They Disregard the reality of my Emotional Trauma & PTSD



#### &#x2605; They Disregard the reality of my Asperger's


#### &#x2605; Through their response to my appeals for help in any situation by invoking Guilt/Shame/Anxiety

so why should it come as a surprise that I'm hardly proactive about
reaching for psychological help?

#### &#x2605; Willful Disregard of My Statements and Arguments

There is no intellectual consequence when I talk to my family
- Mostly my mother, brother & sister.
  - They simply don't absorb any of my statements or arguments
  - There is no consequence to a discussion unless it moves me into a
    more disadvantageous disposition.
- it's as if they have been told to disregard what I say until such
  time when I can be locked away.
  - almost like they've been trained to treat me this way
- At best, it is as if they approach the situation believing that all
  of my statements & actions are to be regarded as the statements &
  actions of lunatic. That is, they approach any of my statements as
  though there is no basis in reality. As though, I should be wearing
  a straight jacket.
  - when, in fact, I have a coherent

At worst, it's as if they willfully disregard any of my statements as
part of an attempt to put me in a worse position.
- To cut off any aid/attention from others; to prevent from having too
  look or feel responsible for anything in my situation.

#### &#x2605;

#### &#x2605; No emphasis on routines (part of a total lack of realistic planning)

Tie into Aspergers Diagnosis
- this demonstrates willful ignorance of my diagnosis

#### &#x2605; Acting like they're the sole benefactors in my life.

- like I would have nothing else to fall back on
  - the intent here is to stoke my fear and compel me to remain
    cornered by emphasizing that I have no other options
  - while refusing to offer any further assistance
- "no one else has ever helped you" is a terrible message to drive
  home day after day, week after week
  - especially to someone who needs help, in general
  - and, specically, to someone who needs help with an abusive
    relationship (that of my mother)
- but this statement "we are the only one's who have ever helped you,
  no one else is will help you" is a staple in almost every single
  argument I have with my mom
  - this is one of her general fallback tactics, when she's close to
    losing an argument, she will invariable make this and other
    statements in an attempt to distract me.
  - she utilizes my poor short-term memory against me, which is
    another sign that she would use my own mental health issues
    against me.
  - so, she seeks to distract me from real progress, when discussing
    almost any issue.
    - she is antithetical to any real progress
    - she harbors intense negativity towards me in her heart
    - she does not want me to be successful, EVER
    - she actively wants me to fail.
    - she wants me to fail in a way that allows her to retain
      influence in how the story of my life is conveyed to other
      people.
    - she does not want to accept any accountability for my
      mis-treatment.
    - IT IS ABOUT SAVING FACE AND AVOIDING FAULT.
    - IT IS ABSOLUTELY NOT ABOUT WHAT IS BEST FOR DAVID CONNER.
    - IT IS ABOUT "HOW DO I LOOK LIKE I DIDN'T SET UP THIS MENTAL HEALTH TRAINWRECK"


    my mental health,
    family,


#### &#x2605; Gaslighting me

-

#### &#x2605; Generally shaming me or guilting me for everything

#### &#x2605; Shaming me for reaching out for medical & mental health

- shaming me for cost

#### &#x2605; They guilt me for lack of social maturity, while
 restricting learning experiences

 They continue to restricting me from experiencing the events which
 would provoke the kind of social maturation that occurs in 20-30 year
 olds. This

I can't emphasize how cruel this is. I have Asperger's. I don't know
how else to say it. I would have been much better off, but **I lacked
virtually all social interaction b/w the ages 20 to 30.** How can you
expect someone to socially develop who is intentionally isolated,
while subject to emotional trauma leaving him with PTSD. This occurs
with virtually zero emotional support system, where the people who are
supposed to be the strongest connections instead contribute to the
shaming and mentally corroding tactics.

It occurs for about a decade. And then the person who experiences the
pain, who's much worse off emotionally, is the person at fault?! When
can someone else accept some responsibility here?! How is it fair to
expect me to pick myself up? IT'S NOT! It is unrealistic to expect me
to do so and it implies that my family, at best, lacks a rational
plan.  And worse, it may imply their cooperation in a plan to
discredit and destabilize me.

Observing everything first-hand leaves me wondering how this perfect
storm of mental health treatment came together.

#### &#x2605; Their idea of "Treatment Plan" is wait idly by until
they have induced enough depression/aggrivation/guilt/shame to induce
some reaction that justifies locking me away, while claiming they were
simply "too busy" with their own lives and "it never was their problem
anyways"

#### &#x2605; Suppression of Propagation of Information Related to My Situation

#### &#x2605; Active Avoidance of Discussion of Problems or Treatment Plan

#### &#x2605; Active Avoidance of Discussion of PTSD or Asperger's

#### &#x2605; Active Engagement in Behavior which Exacerbates PTSD & Asperger's

#### &#x2605; Connections are not shared

#### &#x2605; Only negative information is propagated through the family's social connections

#### &#x2605; My social naivety is used against me. I am never informed to correct for negative behaviors; There are active attempts to prevent me from being exposed to or learning positive behaviors

#### &#x2605; Never rewarded with training on skills or experience. My
 brother and employees at the rink actively seek to prevent me from
 learning new on-the-job skills, which would improve my hireability!!

#### &#x2605; Restriction of new social/work experiences, from which I could learn!

#### &#x2605; Constantly guilted and shamed and controlled through
 invocation of negative emotional responses. In other words, my family,
 through their actions/reactions, compels me to suffer in a swamp of
 negative emotions. They exacerbate my depression and I know that my
 mom does this intentionally.

#### &#2605; There are active attempts to




- i'm glad i don't have the simple duplication of knowledge that
  most people in life have, spoonfed to them by academic
  institutions. the level of passion that i feel when i am
  absorbing new knowledge could have only ever been sparked
  through years of struggling with ignorance and imagination.
  - i was scared when i realized i had no idea how to start a
    business. i saw my level of ignorance of the legal,
    logistic, social and administrative hurdles of doing so and
    that's the seed that I planted in myself in 2007. the only
    time I had thought about starting a business before that was
    in 2005 when I read about George Soros and found myself a
    bit jealous that it would be "easy" for him to affect policy
    and politics. obviously, it's not actually "easy" for a
    billionaire to make such changes.
  - Since 2007, I have been driven by the prospect of being
    rewarded by hard work. i knew it would be hard to start a
    business, but when i failed so miserably in social life, i
    eventually decided I didn't care. It wasn't worth my time
    and I would sacrifice as much time previously invested in
    social life as possible. so, yes, i see myself as having
    made immense sacrifices for the kind of life that i wanted
    to pursue and I'm very angry to see how people interfered
    before 2013. i feel like i was kept purposefully ignorant of
    many facets of life, so that i would remain at a
    disadvantage. today, the possibility that someone in my
    personal or professional life would try to shield me from
    experience or knowledge infuriates me, though i acknowledge
    that often i'm mistaken.
    - however, i simply don't give a !@#$ if I'm wrong that
      someone is purposefully shielding me from
      experience/knowledge... why? BECAUSE THERE'S NOT A SINGLE
      PERSON ENGAGING *ME* IN MY PERSONAL/PROFESSIONAL LIFE TO
      ADDRESS A PERSONAL DEFICIT OF KNOWLEDGE, EXPERIENCE, or
      SOCIAL INTERACTION/CONNECTION
      - i.e. these are minimized in my life, as though someone
        is using linear regression to find the optimal means of
        passively surpressing me while acting like they had no
        influence on my life.

- I wanted sooo badly to understand business models, economics,
  fluid dynamics, mathematics, philosophy, chaos theory, my
  shortcomings with social life, haskell, how to write myself a
  haskell, etc. etc.
  - i can't !@#$'ing blow the leaves or mow the yard or pour sugar
    into water without visualizing and becoming bewildered with
    maths i don't understand.
    - i look around and it seems that:
      - (1) the smarter children a decade younger have an
        insurmountable advantage from online education
      - (2) the things i want to learn which are so trivial for me
        to absorb seem to be very difficult for
        others.
        - i.e. others in life, others in my profession, my
          teachers, people i look up to, etc.
        - for them? these subjects/topics/questions are:
          - completely unknown
          - prohibitively difficult
          - a worthwhile challenge
          - something learned in college but forgot
          - rarely something they picked up easily
          - rarely something they want to explain
          - something used for work and .... eugh it's work --
            they just don't want to talk about it. they don't have
            that same passion
      - (3) and finally, it just seems that no one in my current
        personal life gives a flying !@#$ about what i do with my
        time.
        - it's amazing. people will complain about how much money
          i require, but never about how efficiently i spend my
          time.
        - worse, if *I, MYSELF*, feel that i've begun using
          my time wisely and i'm efficiently making progress on
          some subject or project -- THAT is precisely when my mom
          interferes with a positive, productive pattern.
          - this specific point: i keep stressing it. i feel guilty
            for doing so, but i'll mention it to friends, family, and
            whoever doesn't ignore me and the best response i get is
            basically: `you're paranoid! I heard about you. you're
            crazy. my friends say the doctors say so. your own mother
            simply wouldn't sabotage you or seek to distract you from
            being productive. that's not what she said. she says she
            cares so much about you and she just doesn't
            understand. you can't get mad at her if she doesn't
            understand` ~> not literal, but i get the feeling that's
            the frame of almost any conversation where I braindump my
            life on someone or ask for help
          - honestly though: i simply do not give a !@#$ about
            whether my mom thinks she is or is not sabotaging my
            projects or learning in life. i just don't care if
            that's what she intends or doesn't intend. in fact, if
            that is so, it's morbidly depressing! that's not the
            reality i want.
            - quite simply: what I want? to have a COMMUNITY. Why?
              so that the single person with which i have 99% of
              conversations longer than 60 seconds is not my
              mother.
            - the stats on social interactions and connections in
              my life (for someone who is often accused of having
              mental health issues) IS ALARMING.
              - it should alarm people that i have almost ZERO
                conversations with people for longer than 60
                seconds, but i am absolutely not exagerating when
                i say that one or two months passed in 2016 where
                I may not have spoken with more than 5 people for
                longer than 60s (in phone, online, in person,
                whatever)
              - people wonder why i vent on social media? because
                the fucking facebook and twitter textboxes can't
                ignore me. i detest being in situations where
                someone simply expects you to not say
                something. that's the trick of a con-artist.
                - "oh, it doesn't matter if you do X or cause Y or
                  say Z to his face. don't worry about it. HE
                  WON'T SAY SHIT"
                - i'm simply not going to let that happen. when i
                  tweet controversial or depressing shit it's
                  because it's a cry for help. it's because it
                  feels like there is not a single person who
                  *LISTENS* to what i say or what I write.
                - i'm not in danger of hurting myself, so it's not
                  that kind of cry for help. instead, it's someone
                  who knows exactly how other people are
                  un/intentionally restricting his social
                  life. this person understands that, to succeed,
                  he needs to:
                  - (1) talk to more people
                  - (2) talk to people who share interests in:
                    intellectual topics, startups, etc.
                  - (3) be able to run small talk with other
                    people (without going insane from isolation
                    and never having an outlet for intellectual
                    topics)
                  - (4) make IRL social appearances at events,
                    meetups, etc where like-minded people attend
                  - (5) strengthen connections with both old and
                    new friends
                  - (6) generally increase quantity and quality of
                    total connection
                  - (7) demonstrate value and relevance after
                    career assassination in a world that has
                    derided this person as literally schizophrenic
                    (falsely)
                  - (8) increase the number of locations that i
                    frequent (which is restrained by my TOTAL lack
                    of income)
                    - this makes me incredibly predictable (where
                      am i today?! *i'm at the !@#$'ing coffee
                      shop*! why? because i can focus there and it
                      costs me two dollars to sit and eat walnuts)
                      wants to ruin my life, then this is
                      incredibly *convenient*. the targeted
                      individual can be dependably restrained to a
                      minimal number of locations (after being
                      subjected to career assassination and
                      deprived of income)
                    - these gangstalkers don't need to guess where
                      i'm going to be *because they already know
                      that at ANY time of day, there is a 50%
                      chance that I'm at the coffee shop in salem,
                      va.
                      - therefore, it's quantifyably simpler and
                        statistically preferable for a group of
                        gangstalkers who'd want to [1] show up in
                        a place that person frequents or [2] staff
                        individuals to scope those locations.
                        - it's !@#$'ing *MATH*. once someone has
                          been virtually blacklisted and their
                          family is tired of feeling the
                          thumbscrews, that person is deprived of
                          income and has no where to
                          go. quantifyably, they have both fewer
                          locations available to frequent and
                          fewer types of actions available to
                          them.
                  - (9) manage to dodge the people that
                    un/intentionally do this person social harm
                    - and i swear to God, there really is a group
                      of people that is "out to get me" and i have
                      no fucking clue who it is, but this group of
                      people wants nothing other than to ensure
                      that they *passive aggressively* ruin my
                      life.
                    - i don't really care who these people are and
                      i'd prefer to ignore the thoughts that there
                      are such groups of people. the harm that any
                      group of people could do to an individual
                      simply cannot outweigh the good that
                      individual can do for him or her self, in
                      life.
                      - this is precisely why it is paramount that
                        i prevent myself from being scrubbed out
                        of life and all-but-socially erased.
            - again, i don't actually care why i'm in this
              particular spot. but those nine or ten factors
              above? i realizes that if I manage to qualitatively
              improve *just one of them* that my life is
              better. only one of those points involves paranoid
              assumptions (#9) and I mentioned that i do not give
              a fuck about whether it's true
              - every other point above is simply something that
                quantitatively improves ANY INDIVIDUAL'S social
                life.
  - my passion and ignorance have been at odds with my imagination
    for well over a decade.
- step four: load them on my kindle and pretend like i might
  actually read 200,000 pages of content someday

- Step 3 seems slow and stupid, but actually initiates the
  process of internalizing the knowledge: i'm quickly reviewing
  everything and it takes way longer than it should, but i'm
  prestructuring the content in my head
  - again, it's incredibly inefficient (then again no one
    assists me learning at home or even encourages me, so it's
    not like i have very many options as alternatives)
    - this is good and bad. i would prefer a community i can
      easily associate with me. most people would have given up
      a long, long time ago...
    - but the fact that there are ZERO people in my *personal*
      life who seem concerned with *encouraging me*, it means
      that the only way to avoid giving up on learning about all
      these fascinating subjects is to adamantize my resolve and
      refuse to give in to reality
      - reality: i have made less than $400 this year
      - also reality: i am an incredibly talented person who
        deserves opportunity and for whom it would be tragic for
        his talent for learning to remain untapped.
        - there is a huge divide b/w the way society treats me
          and my skillset and unquenchable passion for learning.
        - I COULD DO SO MUCH MORE FOR SOCIETY IF I HAD
          *COMMUNITY*. i am simply not connected to a community
          of people who encourages me to develop, which is
          partially my own social failure. it's incredibly sad,
          but if it's not easy for me to tap into such a
          community, i just don't. in roanoke, it is VERY
          DIFFICULT for me to tap into such a community
        - again, i know what it feels like to have a hackerspace
          or coworking space right down the street (that is
          simply not true for me, in roanoke)
          - similarly, i know what it feels like to have to
            choose between 2 or 3 technology, etc. meetups
            *every single weekday*
          - i know what that feels like *to actually have a
            community* that drives me to learn, but I DO NOT
            HAVE IT IN ROANOKE. if i had never left roanoke, i
            might not know what that feels like or how "normal"
            it feels to the programmers and academics who live
            in those areas.
          - worse still, in roanoke, it's my past that holds me back:
            80% of the shit i shovel in roanoke is (or at least, WAS)
            from people's pre-existing impression of me and my life.


- i feel like i've learned more in each September, October and
  November, than I have in the second half of 2016
  - why? because I know I'm learning about topics which i have
    mostly unexplored. many of them are intuitive for me, but
    i'm beginning to realize that some personal beliefs of mine
    have been:
    - (1) factually incorrect at times (and laughably so --
      which is how i begin to realize how EASY it would be for
      people to inform me so)
      - occasionally i can deduce that people either weren't or
        aren't on my side because they couldn't be bothered to
        call me out.
        - often it's because they didn't have the time or energy
        - or they didn't want to tell me i was wrong
      - but god !@#$$# sometimes it's because they just wanted
        me to remain disempowered or continue sounding stupid.
        - the number of times this occured is fairly rare, but i
          look back on the conversations i had and realize how
          little anyone ever said to me.
        - it's most obvious when it's trivial for someone to
          correct you (e.g. white eggs are white because they've
          been bleached. no! that's laughably wrong and requires
          minimal investment to correct. i still laugh at this,
          btw)

- whatever people in my life throw my way when i begin visibly
  demonstrating progress. seriously, it feels like at all times,
  there is a handful of people with significant influence in my
  life, whose *objective* is to prevent me from accomplishing
  anything but homelessness in my life.
  - it feels like this group of people has signed away some
    plea-bargin whereby their testicles get squeezed out in a vice
    grip if i'm not homeless/etc by 2030
  - as in, straight up mafia tactics, but legal, encouraged and
    *incredibly illegal to talk about without significant
    ramifications*
  - in late 2015 & in 2016, for the first time in my life, i saw
    that people who i had known for months and years begin to
    interact with me *fearfully*
    - "there is nothing to fear but fear itself" and i saw it, in
      their eyes. and i understood, perhaps incorrectly, that if i
      connect to them or depend on them or engage with them, they
      may end up paying a price for it...
      - *that* is a really, really, shitty feeling, by the way.
      - in the past few months, i don't often get this vibe from
        friends/strangers old or new. it was the way they looked
        at me. i don't know how to explain it and i couldn't
        discern whether it was true or not, but it did not feel
        very good.
      - and because i felt that it was fear or nervousness
        stemming from me, I felt guilty relying on these people,
        opting instead to become more isolated, which has been
        driving all of my problems.

### tactics to distract

- as much as others claim to help, 95% of what i'm asking for is
  refused with tactics that control/derail the conversation
  - e.g. make david angry about something. anything. it's easy.
  - e.g. make david guilty about something. anything. it's easy.
  - e.g. make david know that it's his fault. everything.
  - e.g. generally prefer to avoid conversations with david, if at all
    possible. (the flipside of this is that it limits my desire to
    engage in conversations)
  - e.g. do not budge on anything. the stakes are high (apparently)
  - so, anytime i ask for something, there are about 6 tactics i find
    employed against me, which strain the relationship and make me
    feel like i should rather not ask for anything at all.
    - this stands in contrast to the simplicity of many suggestions i
      have described for:
      - (1) improving my social life
      - (2) improving the efficiency of processes related to a project
      (app or startup)
      - (3) helping me find other people who can help me on a project,
        distract me from my pain, etc.
- the people in my life are *so* good at this (i.e. *handling* me) IT
  IS AS IF SOMEONE HAS *TRAINED* THEM TO DO SO. it's as if someone has
  trained them to handle "difficult situations with david conner" with
  words/actions/tactics that are designed to escalate any interaction
  so that it *becomes* my fault.
  - "no i can't give you that because look at how (pick one: angry,
    ungrateful, guilty, burdensome, worthless, hopeless, etc.) you
    are"
    - it is as if someone has conditioned my mom, specifically, to
    handle me in this way and convinced her that it is what is best
    for me...
- and all i can do is blame my mom... that is pathetic,
  regardless. but my only choice is to give up on everything i've
  dreamed & planned & struggled to do.
  - the only answer seems to be that someone wants me to be a
    loser. that someone has determined that, regardless of how it
    happens, the conclusion is foregone and known to all:
    - DAVID CONNER IS AND ALWAYS WILL BE *AND ALWAYS MUST BE A FAILURE,*
      so that we can hold him up as an example to others.
- it is incredibly fucked up

### surreptitious medication

- wasting time inspecting my food & eating utensils, trying to
  avoid surreptitious medication. it's basically impossible, by
  the way, unless you can lock your refridgerator
  - it also helps to have your own refridgerator, which i recently
    gave away.
  - it sounds crazy, but i have absolutely been drugged w/o my
    knowledge, at least a handful of times. it has happened and
    it's terrifying to think about. no one should even have to
    worry about that.
    - there is "topical" haldol/valium/diphenhydramine paste,
      which is highly potent, but which studies show to be
      ineffective TOPICALLY. orally, however, it is potent enough
      to smudge in someone's cup or on their food. haldol has a
      very long halflife, so one dose lasts one to three days.
    - there is literally no *practical* use case for this
      medication, besides surreptitious medication. it is
      ineffective, topically.
    - search for surreptitious medication. you will find that it
      has only been trending for the past decade and almost
      unheard of before 2000. at the same time, most people are
      completely unaware that such a practice is even possible or
      legal. the haldol paste was developed by Braeburn
      Pharmaceuticals (?) only a few years ago.
      - furthermore, out-patient surreptitious medication implies
        that someone close to that patient has:
        - (1) knowledge of their *complete* medical history, since
          the last thing such an adversary/nurse wants to do is
          induce an overdose
          - this is complicated by substance abuse, but presents
            minimal problems for someone whose life is
            micromanaged and who has no income
        - (2) a trusting relationship with the patient
        - (3) frequent contact with the patient, since to limit
          possible exposure of the information, the person
          supplying the medication must have common contact with
          the patient and enough trust to put it in their food or
          apply it topically.
          - for such controversial treatments, if they are applied
            out-patient, it is preferable to limit this to one
            person.
            - therefore, it should be a roommate, a family member,
              a coworker or a really sheisty friend. keep in mind,
              *private*, up-to-date medical information must be
              sent & received. this person must (should) have
              legal authority to have custody of their
              information. or at least, there must be some legal
              mechanism for shielding this person from questions
              surrounding medication.
            - that is, unless there is a government institution
              that does it. interestingly, FDA code & regulations
              do not prohibit this (AFAIK)
              - FDA code, regulations, forms and documentation
                prompted me with an endless amount of questions.
          - i don't think this happens very often. if at all,
            there are probably less than a thousand patients with
            out-patient surreptitious medication. there's simply
            too much risk in the processes and way too much red
            tape if something goes wrong.
        - (4) legal authority to medicate the patient
          - there's a concept in medical administration which is
            similar to "chain of custody" for evidence, but for
            patients. at all times, in a hospital, each patient's
            current care/responsibility must be known and
            documented. each treatment that is applied must fall
            through a chain of command and it must be known who is
            responsible for each aspect of the patient's
            treatment. this documented authority should apply
            moreso if the patient is unaware of their medication.
        - (5) approval and payment by the insurance company for
          the medication. and for the services of a compounding
          pharmacy, for which the FDA regulations changed less
          than three years ago. Haldol paste is made by
          compounding pharmacies.
        - (6) the pharmacy & compounding pharmacy must have
          approval of the DEA to possess medications for which
          they do not have a prescription
        - (7) knowledge of the pharmacist and whoever is involved
          in (quietly!) transferring the prescription order to a
          compounding pharmacy
      - so, again, unless the surreptitious medication and action
        of medication is ordered & processed by DHS/CIA/etc, then
        it is simply not feasible enough to be a widespread
        occurance.
        - it simply involves:
          - too many people
          - too much risk of overdose & legal complications
          - too much risk of information exposure
          - too much risk of legal complications (malpractice, etc)
          - too much work/process to convince people that it is
            ethical and necessary.
        - furthermore, there is no way to deliver the treatment in
          a scientifically responsible manner. there is absolutely
          no way to ensure that the patient's blood plasma
          medication level does not fluctuate widely. therefore,
          it's unethical because it is unscientific
    - there is also a subcutaneous haldol implant. it's like a
      birth control implant, but for people who are difficult to
      manage. maybe they have DSM V's invented "BPD borderline
      personality disorder" for people who are "too close to the
      border"
      - furthermore, few responsible psychiatrists would prescribe
        a haldol implant. doing so would require at least 6 months
        of psychiatric medication history. since difficult to
        remove an implant, it's *irresponsibly* and *possibly
        fatal* to prescribe/mandate such an implant if they have a
        bad reaction to the medication.
        - the implant is marketed on the plausible basis that "it's
          easier for the patient to manage their medication" --
          they can't forget to take it, which is true, but doesn't
          outweigh the logistic difficulty of establishing patient
