# brief notes on neurogenesis:

  - without supplements to trigger release of or supply Neural Growth
    Factors (NGF) *almost all new neurons will die without support
    from astrocytes, etc*
    - the mechanisms of NGF's like BDNF, etc is to shift epigenetic
      programs to supply support to connections & neurons which need
      reinforcement.
    - There is a five-pronged approach to this strategy:
      - (1) First of all, you need cardiovascular exercise and lots of
        it. this increases the flux of blood carrying oxygen/nutrients
        to your brain. THIS MUST BE THE FIRST THING YOU INCREASE.
        - it will also carry the supplements to deeper regions of your
          brain. you need cardio at least to the point where you are
          mildly out of breath. particularly, you are looking for a
          sensation of blood pumping. when i really get it going,
          after about 5 miles of running, there seems to be mild
          tingling in the back of my brain, which subjectively seems
          to indicate good things happening, but may just be a runners
          high.
        - still, the intent is to change how the blood flows through
          the brain to carry higher levels of oxygen, nutrients and
          especially the supplements to where they need to go: deeper
          capillary networks of the brain that can tend to lack
          quantities of blood flux.
        - if you're not engaging in cardio, you're wasting your time
          -- and your money.
      - (2) You must find creative cognitive-behavioral techniques and
        activities that challenge the neurological deficits you feel
        that you have. This will focus the brain's epigenetic
        machinery onto those circuits which are strained -- or at
        least, that is the idea. Doing this will (fingers crossed)
        result in changes in the brain where you need them. In
        actuality, it really may not.
        - Still, in MRI & fMRI research, repeated activation of neural
          circuits/pathways is required. why?  because only by
          encouraging those regions to increase oxygen intake can you
          assume that fMRI changes correlate to exerted neural
          activity. The idea is the same, exert the regions of the
          brain that result in neurological or psychological
          challenges using CBT.
      - (3) You need to ensure you have a balanced diet and especially
        mineral intake. you should be taking Magnesium L-threonate.
        See below for why. You should be supplementing with omega-3's,
        but you do not need to take them every single day. they need
        to have DHA.
      - (4) you need herbs like Bacopa or Ashwaganda to trigger
        release of neurotrophic factors like BDNF. these can also be
        supplied using drugs like Cerebrolysin and/or Semax, but those
        are dangerous.
      - (5) You need to increase green tea intake, as well as other
        supporting herbs, like
      - (6) Optional: you can use a vasodialator like Panax Ginseng
        extract, to augment the impact of cardio on the flow of
        oxygen/nutrients/supplements to the very back of the brain

- warnings on this strategy:
  - (1) you are toying with the epigenetic machinery in your brain.
    - in adolescents and before the brain "stops developing" at 25,
      there are programs running *with subtleties and nuance to their
      course of action*. THE APPLICATION OF HIGH-LEVELS OF NGF'S WILL
      TRIGGER FEEDBACK LOOPS WHICH GRADUALLY SHUT DOWN THE RELEASE OF
      NATURAL NGF'S -- while exerting other, unstudied effects that
      cannot possibly be good for someone whose brain is developing!!
  - (2) you are toying with the epigenetic machinery in your brain.
    - if you increase rates of neurogenesis, but have fundamentally
      weak tumor suppressor genes, you're promoting growth of various
      types of brain cells. If you do this with significant impact or
      in the extreme, then your brain may experienced uncontrolled
      growth that its tumor suppression mechanisms can't prune away.
    - if you are at risk of a brain tumor (and you probably won't
      know) then unless you want chemo, reconsider what you're doing.
    - i am very much testing these methods on myself because i don't
      really care what happens, since they might be long-term effects
      and with vultures encircling me overhead -- the long-term just
      doesn't matter. let's be real for a minute, damn!


# Nootropic Supplements & Purpose

### Magnesium L-Threonate


- this transports magnesium across the blood-brain barrier faster,
  while being cheaper than every single INNEFECTUAL magnesium
  supplement on the market.
- If you live on planet earth, YOU HAVE A MAGNESIUM DEFICIENCY: look
  on the damn food labels at the grocery story and find a single damn
  one with more than 10% magneisum per serving. Further, the body
  can't process what's in the chemical supplements because they are
  simply ionic compounds which happen to have magnesium in them, BUT
  ARE NOT BIOAVAILABLE.
- magnesium is at least partially responsible for the mental health
  crisis in the developed world. Magnesium deficiencies might be the
  sole largest factor that -- ABOVE ALL OTHER FACTORS INCLUDING
  THERAPY AND MEDICATION -- could result in the single biggest
  difference in rates/prognoses/complications of mental health issues.
  - AND IT IS LOW-HANGING FRUIT!!! It is so simple to add BIOAVAILABLE
    magnesium to food. what does it do? it's one of the four
    fundamental ions that are necessary for ion channels to funcion
    properly in the brain. it interacts with the glutamate system.
    - but (IMO) magnesium seems to calms you down and encourage more
      healthy large-scale patterns of neurological activity which are
      balanced
    - Milk of Magnesia is or was formally administered to any person
      undergoing a mental health breakdown because of its calmative
      effect. BUT ALMOST EVERY SINGLE PERSON IN THE WORLD WHO IS NOT
      SPECIFICALLY SUPPLEMENTING FOR MAGNESIUM HAS A DEFICIENCY!!
      - EVERY.FUCKING.SINGLE.PERSON.IN.THE.DEVELOPED.WORLD.
      - can i fucking make that any louder? It is low hanging
        fruit. eliminate magnesium deficiencies and it results in
        major impacts to the rates and severity of mental health
        conditions.

### Green Tea Extract

- ECGC stimulates neurogenesis and IT'S FANTASTIC FOR YOUR SKIN
- however, you must ensure that your extract is sourced from green tea
  which has been grown in a clean area, since tea plants have a
  tendency to leach lead and other heavy metals into them -- but only
  if those are in the local soil
  - when brewing tea, this isn't as much of a problem, since most of
    the lead and heavy metals stay within the tea and don't tend to
    leach into the water (also a good reason to use proper brewing
    temperature for your teas, since higher temperatures cause a
    greater spectrum of chemicals to diffuse into solution)
  - when taking tea extract supplements, this is a huge problem,
    because your body does absorb
- the ECGC-spectrum Green Tea extracts (from NootropicsDepot), which
  are focused on ECGC and actually have low-stimulant content -- these
  are great bc you can take MORE of them without worrying about
  increasing caffiene intake.
  - (TODO: move to general discussion on Neurogenesis) however,
    stimulating too much neurogenesis may destabalize your neural
    networks because of how they must rebalance themselves in the
    presence of new connections -- or that is the sense that I get,
    which is purely subjective reflection on my experience. so, these
    strategies need to be intended as long-term.

  - the ECGC-extra does not make me feel *as* good as simply drinking
    organic matcha tea, prepared [somewhat] traditionally. products
    with matcha on the label aren't going to help much. it needs to be
    matcha tea, prepared with a basic whisk at the proper temperator.
    - the whisk introduces oxygen/air which subtly changes the
      solution and mildly activates it in a way. i'm not sure of how
      critical this is, but that's why the solution becomes bubbly:
      some of the ingredients are becoming oxygenated. (i think..)
    - matcha tea delivers even better results for the softness of my
      skin. it makes me want to feel my skin, which is kind of wierd i
      guess. however, i'm the last person on earth anyone should
      expect to say "and it does wonders for my skin!"
      - i only noticed it because of how pronounced an effect it has

- rates of ECGC absorption double and triple on an empty stomach with
  an acidic compostion. green tea extract and matcha should be taken
  with this in consideration.


### *-Racetam


### Acetyl L-Carnitine (ALCAR)

- long-term change of ALCAR balance in mitochondrial system?
- encourages metabolization of fatty acids for energy in Mitochrondria
  whose ALCAR is supplemented/restored
- you want this system *in balance* **not out of balance**, since
  excess may reverse the implications (verify?) causing
  cells/mitochondria to prefer carbs over fatty acids, so dosages
  should be light, interspersed randomly (skipping days) and *not
  excessive)
- this is a great supplement to take:
  - when adding coconut oil to your diet,
  - when decreasing sugars/carbs,
  - when adding Omega-3's (though these don't relate to mitochrondria
  do they?) and when engaging in a ketogenic diet

- (if it works for altering metabolization dynamics) because of the
  generally stabalizing effect of MCT and and other fatty acids on
  *regulated, consistent metabolization*.
  - therefore, (and this all needs verification), but it should cause
    your brain

### Cerebrolysin

- comments on the expense and difficulty in finding the right filters,
  which alone will cost you $250!
- comments on potential infections. problems during shipping or after
  receipt can lead to *intramuscular* infections if you break a vial
  or handle them improperly.
  - a single IM infection will set your quad's, glutes or deltoids(?)
    back so far -- if it doesn't KILL YOU -- that you may regret it
    for the rest of your life if you are an athlete. IM injections
    must be 5cc's or less, generally in the thigh region, or they are
    not safe because they do tissue damage.
    - so, when your *muscles* swell up like rotting hams and you can't
      walk and every step causes pain, that pain indicates tissue
      damage which may be PERMANENT. this is absolutely not something
      to toy around with, because if you are an athlete, it will take
      two weeks for you to get to the point where you can *begin* to
      recover the tissue damage.
    - oh, and if you prep IM shots and space them out, then if one
      gets infected, it will form growths of bacteria within it. so if
      you decide to instead use this shot IV, *SUCH GROWTHS MAY
      TRIGGER A STROKE OR EDEMA*, if not re-filtered.
      - I very, very nearly missed such growths of bacteria, but
        reflitered the shot and administered IV. I had the worst
        fever-experience I've ever had within 20 minutes. It provoked
        an extreme immune-system reaction because it was essentially
        the same as giving myself *SEPSIS* in the *BLOOD* and
        provoking an extreme cytokine storm. Luckily, i knew how to
        respond with one or two herbs in an attempt to provoke/support
        immune system response (high maca root doses for adrenal
        support, and elderberry extract)
      - however, i would never recommend anyone else to do anything
        but rush to the emergency room in such a situation. i was
        basically unsure of whether I would die, since the fever came
        on so quickly and became more severe than any migraine i ever
        had as a child.
  - again, it is NOT something to take lightly. cerebrolysin is
    composed of Neural Growth Factors and other proteins extracted
    from pig brains. exposed to the elements, it is immediately
    non-sterile. since you must use this outside of medical
    supervision, any mistake is going to be difficult to explain and
    probably not covered by your insurance.

### Semax

- this is something like a synthetic equivalent to Cerebrolysin,
  intended to be administered by eyedrops ...
  - it doesn't carry the same tendency to breed infections as
    Cerebrolysin.
