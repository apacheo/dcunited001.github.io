- Divine Right vs. the mandate of heaven
  - how was the mandate of heaven similar to the social contract
    theory? (original reference to mandate of heaven )

### (Dynasties)

- what are the methods of inheretence of power called?
  - variations of matrilineal/patrilineal succession
  - how much do these methods of succession imply ancient knowledge of
    [phenomics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phenomics)
    - ancient people knew far more than we gave them credit for.
      - while science and rationalism have opened our world to
        possibilities and stability unknown before the 18th century,
        this obsession with the materialistic and quantifiable has
        blinded us with a deluge of detail (remove?)

- three families close to the japanese emperor for hundreds of years
  - how this served the best interests of the japanese culture
    - before, during and after the time of Nobunaga
  - the emporer had the best interests of the state and the people in
    mind. to serve him was to serve the best interests of everyone.
    - but in order for the emperor and the state to serve the people,
      they had to be connected to the people.
    - over the course of generations, those close to the emperor, the
      families closest to his estate and to the government could
      "move" closer to the emperor by proving themselves
      - this is how it worked with most if not all monarchies, but
        it's interesting how well it worked in Japan, since that
        monarchy has lasted so long. It also lasted a very long time
        in Iran, so it'd be equally interesting to explore there.
      - this dynamic of moving closer and further from the monarch by
        having one's service/character assessed seems to have resulted
        in the system being architected around this.
        - japan also had very tight control of their culture. being
          east-most and geographically separate, they had less inward
          informational sociophysical flux than most, so this made it
          slightly easier to do so.
        - (it seems that this tight control of culture can be seen in
          Shinto, which is a religion that's not meant for people
          outside of japan AFAIK)
      - further, idealistic metaphysics is encoded into their
        language, grammar and thus culture. (see the particle "no")
        - this may cause the Japanese people to think about things
          differently, especially when compared to cultures speaking
          western languages, where there is so much emphasis on
          quantity, possession and the material.
          - i'm not saying one is better than the other...


#### The Dalai Lama As A Metaphysical Dynasty

- The mantle of the Dalai Lama is passed from one generation to
  another. The child to become the Dalai Lama must be identified by
  the Panchan Lama and initiated properly, otherwise he is *not* the
  Dalai Lama. China kidnapped the child identified to become the
  Panchan Lama. This means that this could not have been properly
  initated himself by the current Dalai Lama. If you believe this
  child is capable of identifying a true Dalai Lama in the next
  generation, you are a fool and know nothing of Tibetan traditions.

- How is this a unique dynasty? How is it a good selection of
  leadership for Tibet? To me, this is what is most intriguing about
  the position of Dalai Lama as the highest role of authority in
  Tibet.
  - I am speaking without knowing, but from what I perceive...
  - The Tibetan dynasty offers continual renewal without the conflict
    of revolution. It is presumed that the leader will not be
    concerned with any succession except a succession of the
    reincarnation of ideas. The meticulous reincarnation of the ideal
    values system for their leader.

- If the Panchan Lama is not initiated properly, the Lama lineage
  itself is threatened, but perhaps all is not lost. I don't want to
  explain precisely why.
  - this search for the next leader is not the work of one person or
    simply the people who surround him.


- what reincarnated or reborn beings would be useful to identify
  - for metatypological identification of reborn beings, is it
    possible to simply recognize metatypes of beings?
    - can recognized metatype/types of reborn beings be recognized
      with varying degrees
