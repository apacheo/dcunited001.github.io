How to be Toxic


- imagine the path that someone wanders through their mind. it can
  take them through better or worse places, emotionally,
  intellectually, etc.
  - it's moreso high-dimensional graph, where thoughts are not so much
    a path, but activations on the graph represented by cliques or
    simplexes.
  - thought can be more or less structured. the person thinking can
    exert control over their thoughts.

- paths through the mind which are less structured and travel further
  require more physical energy.

- relationship problems with someone who has cut you off from all
  resources and can thus cause anyone who looks at your life to
  misinterpret it. or, they at least have more power in doing so than
  anywone else, since they are your only first degree connection
  - people see me chasing goal after goal, and changing direction, but
    don't understand why i don't make progress
  - (if you want to destroy someone's life slowly), keep them
    wandering aimlessly between goal after goal, never dwelling long
    enough on one to have anything to show for their effort, no matter
    how hard they work.
