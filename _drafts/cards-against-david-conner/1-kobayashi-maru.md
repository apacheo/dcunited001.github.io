# The Kobayashi Maru of Nihilism

- for all the people who think they’ve “won” or that i’ve “lost”,
  society doesn’t actually work the way you think it does anymore.
  - the truth is, we are all going to lose in a nihilistic crisis that
    robs humanity of any reason for being

- what is a nihilistic crisis and why would it rob humans of any
  reason for being?
  - consider the greatest people through history and, specifically,
    the individuals who advanced humanity the most.
    - consider those to be the greatest, irreplacable people. how
      would they fare in the 2030’s?
      - we just won’t need anyone like them, whatsoever.
      - or, if there is some undesirable individual, all that needs to
        happen is for another person (without the uncomfortable
        associations with the undesirable's identity) to receive a
        copy of the information -- and voila! nothing the undesirable
        did mattered at all.

- case in point: the Millinneum Prize problems for mathematics:
  - getting close to solving 3 out of the remaining 6 problems will
    get you killed before you can make it halfway.
  - this is because you must proove the theorums with one hand tied
    behind your back, where that one hand is the utilization of
    theorums that the NSA hasn't publicly disclosed.

  - go through each problem and describe why it will or will not get
    you killed, just by making significant progress towards the
    solution.
    - the best examples of these are:
      - P vs. NP: the traveling salesman WILL get you killed
        - show pics of the work I had towards bioinformatics
          algorithms, where my family almost threw me in a mental
          institution and I received text threats from someone
          claiming to be a "dating service with the NSA""
      - the Riemannian Hypothesis:
        - making progress towards this one would likely borrow
          techniques and motifs used in the proof for Fermat's last
          theorem, though that had nothing to do with the complex
          plane.

- the point is, there are some achievements that great men could
  attain, towards which man-made institutions would like to stall
  progress, even to the point of killing you if you get close.
  - the math problems aren't even a great example.
  - cheaply producing a tricorder from Star Trek would get you killed
    because it would vaporize profits in health care.
  - producing highly efficient methods in computation chemistry and
    medicine will get you killed because, even though it moves mankind
    forward by a dozen great leaps, it instantly creates systemic
    liability in healthcare as well as for major corporations like
    Monsanto, Dow Chemical and Johnson&Johnson.
  - there are other great leaps forward, which in our era will not be
    the efforts of one man, but of teams of hundreds of
    scientists. since these teams, like those who worked on CERN
    cannot work without billions in funding, this in itself will
    implicitly hold back many advancements.
  - the point is that there are that the Einstein's, Ramanujan's and
    Heisenberg's of our era could accomplish, but would at least have
    their careers assassinated, should specific interest groups
    discover what they're working on.
    - there is more to be discovered that destabalizes economic and
      security imperatives to our era's status quo than truly advances
      the system without disruption unacceptable to special interests.
    - however, stalling this kind of risky progress only helps America
      so much. just because it is a potential systemic risk to us
      doesn't mean it's a systemic risk to everyone: no, it is not
      like that at all. there is much progress we'd like to hold back,
      but cannot prevent China/Russia from attaining. the consequences
      for us will be the same as though we commanded that progress all
      along
      - and if we did, we would own the economic benefits & losses
        associated with the innovation, instead of being stuck with
        the losses after failing to understand game theory.

- (back to that nihilistic crisis)
  - this crisis will make the nihilistic crisis of the 1930’s look
    like a lovely picnic in Europe.
  - it will leave us with nothing but a nihilistic vacuum, which a
    handful of authoritarians will find useful in defining some system
    of values, perhaps ideological, that they believe sound reasonable
    to the average person, who can be contorted into a carnivorous
    extension of their will.
    - in that vacuum, the only value you provide is not what you
      produce, but what you consume.
      - the pre-WWII nihilistic crisis was precipitated by economic
        depression, causing the average European to retreat towards
        the calculations of ideologues, giving themselves over to the
        purpose of serving the ideas or wills of their leaders. that
        is what they retreated into to receive a sense of purpose.
      - in this unfolding nihilistic crisis, mankind will be robbed of
        purpose and offer NO ECONOMIC VALUE WHATSOEVER.
        - this robs us of our humanity because our individual lives
          collectively become a burden on resources and economically
          strain the government.
          - in the past millennia, rulers have outlined options of
            war/etc which always advance multiple agendas.
          - in the coming decades, each human life will be nothing be
            a 2010 USD $30,000+ drain on government, WITH NO CHANCE
            FOR FUNDING
          - how do you cut the government budget in such a world? DO
            THE FUCKING MATH. it is very literally math, economics,
            metaphysics, etc.

- this isn’t about me. my writing hasn’t been about me since 2016. I
  know that i will never be given a chance to do anything or be
  anyone.
  - but it is very amusing to see people condescend over me so smugly,
    since you have no fucking clue what you are giving birth to.

- my writing has the potential to wake people up. my life does not
  matter, per se. so it doesn’t matter what happens to me.
  - why? because the same future unfolds no matter what happens. so
    GLHF.
  - if you’re lucky someone capable of solving the Riddle of the
    Sphinx will also solve the problem of Nihilism, which rapidly
    precipitates as turbulence in our descent towards the Singularity.
  - how do you “solve nihilism” … ?
    - you give people a sense of purpose.
  - how do you do that, without being one of the aforementioned
    authoritarian jerkoffs who lack true universal significance?  (in
    that they were mostly their own group’s means to an end, at the
    expense of everyone else outside their group)
    - you create a belief system centered around a set of universal
      values, capable of causing humanity to spontaneously choose to
      crystalize around it,
      - where they choose to leave no one behind.

- the problem of course is that you have to sell people on this, while
  the world is falling apart, knowing that everything that happens in
  every future while always happens and there is nothing that can be
  done about that.

- so uhhh, if you think i’ve “lost” or that you’ve “won” …. you’re
  blind. you’re worse than what athiests call “not even wrong” because
  you’re not even trying.
  - further: we’re giving rise to a generation who finds the term
    “try-hard” amusing, without caring to consider the
    socio-linguistic consequences at the outset of a nihilistic
    crisis. the very thing we need is people who try hard and don’t
    ask for anything, who don’t care to do anything but to improve
    themselves and the people around them and will ALL try as hard as
    they possibly can.

- but have you ever read my writing? i’m clearly a try-hard … and how
  does society treat me and others like me?

Cards Against David Conner #3: Autopsychoanalysis

- back to my personal life, in case people think i’m crazy.
- let me be clear: in no way do i give a shit about whose “fault” this
  is. i only care about the facts of my life that will explain where i
  am to help me move forward.
  - one problem that prevents me from seeing clearly now is that i
    have been mostly unconscious to the impact that social factors
    have had on my life …
     - until now. so there are many things which could i could have
       done. simultaneously, three things stick out
       - (1) i have been abused in the workplace resulting in PTSD
         which robs me of financial independence while i have a
         developmental disorder which i know that people in my life
         understand, yet they don’t acknowledge and seek to downplay
         the impact it has on my life.
       - (2) i know that so many people, mostly older, should have
         been there for me to help lead me to transcend the
         limitations of this developmental disorder, didn’t actually
         do that and instead ignored me at best. or worse, they wanted
         me to fail, so they could use my suffering as an allegory for
         the next
         generation in my family/communities/whatever and felt completely justified in doing so primarily bc i smoked weed and talked about the government
          - this is of course, while you are becoming disconnected,
             where the only informational images of you percolate into
             society are disinformation produced by a rumor mill
             running at full-steam or by your own social media
             responses — which mostly reflect someone crying out for
             help who is unconscious to what is happening, who doesn’t
             have anyone actually in their life to help them, but does
             have a few people planning on using them as a fantastic
             trainwreck story to tell their kids, like some kind of
             child actor

           - and this is all so that society can mold your life’s narrative into an allegory for the next generation, before it’s entirely forgotten.
             - Southpark did an episode about it (more or less) where they sacrifice Britney Spears, although my life isn’t ALL SOO intentional.
             - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZlP3T6n7o48
          - at best, when everyone goads you into being the kind of spectacular train wreck that is both fun to watch but also easy to rewrite later on.
            - you’re raised as someone’s only partially aware puppet, who doesn’t understand the consequences of their actions whatsoever.
            - it’s this version of you that is well-connected and whose memories are well-embedded through society.
            - then later, along the way you were gradually extracted from social connections, leaving only the memories which ripple through society to be those
              the completely unconscious, younger version of yourself created
              (i.e. the PRE-PROGRAMMED version of you that was fun to watch who only later inexplicably turned into a bitter, mostly disconnected asshole, whose
              pain no one took seriously — because that’s the point of the artificial narrative, it’s a fable with a lesson. if people identify with your pain for what it is,
              then they don’t accept it as the kind of allegory that controlled demolition was meant to be)

           - Socrate’s was also charged with corrupting the youth and revealing the Eleusinian mysteries, which are connected to each other…
             - he also produced no writing that remains.

       - (3) also, i’m kind of bitter, so i seem like an asshole, who
          isn’t beholden to any pecking order games, so it’s hard to
          read where i fit into the social strata.  so, then people
          misread “my place” in society. all the time. they have
          whatever rules they feel like are valid for determining
          whether someone is above or below them. because i have
          aspergers, i have never given a shit about any of that.
          - but this drives people crazy because it matters so much to
            them. then they either think highly of me and see people
            shit on me, or they think nothing of me and try to assert
            the pecking order, believing it to be an easy assertion of
            dominance which allows people nearby to see the clear
            winner of that interaction…. all without realizing that,
            while i don’t give a shit about the pecking order, i
            realllllly don’t like being tested by petty people who
            do. at best people who “consciously” tell themselves that
            they think they are above me, seek to use me as a kind of
            “Has-Been” benchmark, and thus subconsciously must believe
            themselves below you because in order to get to higher
            places, they have to demonstrate that they are higher in
            the pecking order than you, however they conceive that
            society values whatever they seek to demonstrate.
            - and, by the way, if you don’t understand social physics
              and what i write about (at least intuitively, in your
              own terms) then you don’t actually understand what
              society values, but only weakly reinforced notions of
              what you think society seems to think it values. when a
              bunch of people who similarly don’t understand social
              physics send you ambiguous signals that you have no
              abstractions to symbolically, systemically or
              ontologically interpret/explain, you don’t really
              understand, you only think you understand. irony comes
              in all flavors, but this is a social retard telling you
              that you’re an idiot for consciously asserting a pecking
              order if it feels good and you don’t understand what i
              write about. and if you do understand, but still assert
              the pecking order because it’s useful, without regard to
              how it affects other people, then you are almost
              certainly a SOCIOPATH or a MALIGNANT NARCISSIST.
              - that is very literally what a sociopath is. it is
                someone who PATHOLOGICALLY uses SOCIAL methods to
                maneuver, often with catastrophic results if not in
                the lives of others, than in their own lives once
                people catch on.
              - it is the sociopath which has destroyed my life over
                and over and over again for about 15 years. so you’re
                damn right i’ve deconstructed what they do to the
                maximum extent possible, so that anyone can call them
                on their malignant bullshit. and i haven’t even
                started talking about NLP/hypnosis.

  - again, it is not about who is right and who is wrong, but how my
    life can be fixed and how i am supposed to move forward.
     - again, i’m not judging. the only reason i’m stuck in the
       situation i’m in is because i don’t have access to society.
     - when i refer to my family, i’m almost entirely talking about my
       1º family members, who i feel were more conscious than they let
       on, but still, i’m only doing this because i am left with no
       choice.
     - why does social isolation matter? it means i have no access to
       information, which makes every problem that i deal with much
       harder.
       - i can explain thoroughly how this isolation is needed for a
         dozen things that all overlap on a need to create the social
         isolation within the victim.
     - but when the people closest to you project harmful
       misinformation that restricts your social access (intentionally
       or not) then it keeps you in a vulnerable spot where you toil
       with the same problems over and over. most people give up. i
       discovered social physics. i don’t have to give up. all i have
       to do is keep writing and i will transform the world with my
       mind. why? because nothing is hidden from me anymore. it’s like
       i have x-ray vision to analyze any situation whatsoever. some
       people might not understand, but it’s only a matter of time
       before i come into contact with people who do understand. what
       has been used to control me and ruin my life has ruined the
       lives of countless other lives just like mine. revealing that
       for what it is will have systemic effects.
       - furthermore, these methods of controlling people will no
         longer function because they can’t be hidden. data science
         can identify people who are intentionally socially
         isolated. this provides you with a target list. filter the
         target list for people who share many of the same 1º and 2º
         connections and those are the abusers. the more isolated a
         target is, the fewer connections they have. when a person is
         connected to many extremely isolated people, they are likely
         an abuser. find the networks of abusers who overlap the most,
         then you have a set of prospects for investigation.
         - it’s not hard. the only thing you have to do is challenge
           the system that says surveillance can only be used to make
           people suffer. then you get the data.
         - this is only one way to deconstruct and destroy the system
           that has made me suffer. trust me, i’ve spent a lot of time
           thinking about this.

- while i refer to a lot of hypotheticals and use a ton of inductive
  reasoning (which is inefficient and requires validation) …
  - it is of ZERO VALUE to anyone involved to refer to anything that
    is not factual. i want all information presented to me clearly and
    all discussions to proceed logically, with facts and YES EVEN
    INTELLECTUAL IDEAS. it is so convenient that everyone else gets to
    act like they’re just humble country bumpkins or little old
    ladies, when the reality is ALL PEOPLE LEARN TO RELATE TO AND
    INTERACT WITH OTHER PEOPLE WELL — OR THEY FAIL IN LIFE
    - that’s the facts. furthermore, i can demonstrate that every
      parent either intuitively understands psychological concepts in
      their own language (e.g. like Jungian concepts that draw heavily
      from the unconscious or Freudian concepts that relate to
      diffeomorphic stretching/skewing of a mind from the initial
      seeds planted) or they fail at parenthood
    - i can argue very simply and in irrefutable terms that parents
      (especially of multiple children or with with children raised
      years apart) cannot possibly be ignorant of certain aspects of
      developmental psychology, albeit in intuitive terms. and to
      insult the intelligence of a child that you assume will never
      get out from under your foot for long enough to be a parent to
      understand what you understand about raising a child is almost
      unforgivable if it is not addressed for what it really is and
      reversed and ended.

  - why? when people short-circuit psychological/sociological problems
    in an individual’s life by constantly playing stupid or referring
    to convenient explanations
    - (e.g all his problems started as soon as he smoked marijuana and
      everything is because of drugs)
    - then the actual problems are not acknowledged and cannot be
      corrected.
    - so you have short-circuited the problem. if the person is not
      socially isolated, then they might just move on and forget about
      it.
      - but when every single time they get a job — they are
        victimized & abused in ways that no person acknowledges
        causing more problems whose solutions are short-circuited —
        then they are robbed of financial independence.
      - couple this with a developmental disorder WHICH IN MY LIFE IS
        NOT ACKNOWLEDGED, then a socially isolated person will have no
        means of emotionally supporting themselves in crisis. instead,
        the only support/advice that i get is single minded and
        distracts from the actual causes and misattributes the
        problems i have with some moral BS, which leads shaming me and
        marginalizing me, while believing it’s not only justified, but
        that it will actually be helpful.
        - but if you don’t listen to me (or rather, you speak to me as
          though you have not listened to me, intentionally filtering
          out ideas you claim you don’t understand, while
          cherry-picking other specific statements of mine which you
          magically remember and find useful to your argumentation)
          then how can you even know that your moral BS applies?!

  - this is why social physics is so useful to me, because NOW i can
    refer to social metrics that quantify my isolation, where before
    it was all too easy for people to claim i was delusional or to
    threaten to generally label me as paranoid.
    - further i can model anyone’s behavior and it’s impossible to be
      duplicitous with me.
      - so it’s much harder for people to play both sides and give me
        bad advice
      - they can’t claim to support me, while appearing logical, if
        they don’t also support specific goals of mine.
     - furthermore, i’ve written about all of this in my blog, which
       people claim they don’t understand, but then magically don’t
       EVER read or refer to when talking to me, but claim that they’d
       do anything to help me, if they just knew what to do.
       - READ MY WRITING IT EXPLAINS EVERYTHING THAT WAS BEING
         IGNORED. it also would help anyone in my situation avoid
         being abused at work.
       - if you did that, instead of cleverly short-circuiting
         discussion by pushing my buttons, we could move on.
     - but instead, when i wrote about workplace bullying, i was
       screamed at by my mother to delete the writing or i would never
       work again. there was no attempt to listen to me: because she
       already knew enough about what had happened to understand that
       it was no accident that i was tormented at work.
       - that was in 2015.
     - when i write about some of this stuff, i can actually move
        on. why? because if i need to get support from people, i can
        link them to an article i’ve written, which they can read much
        faster than i can explain. or that’s the idea, at least. and i
        don’t have to spend 3 hours trying to build up the background
        behind what happened to me in Boulder and why i should be
        taken seriously when i say i have PTSD.

=========

- explain impact of childhood head injury (with aspergers or causing
  PDD-NOS)
  - left completely unattended by people who coddled me through
    high-school with zero realistic plans for how i would make it
    through college alone (except a giant $20,000 check, which makes
    no sense if you think about it)
  - no one ever overtly acknowledged my memory problems in childhood
    and it seems like people even sought to make me feel like
    absentmindedness/disorganization/etc was completely normal (or
    even humourous) so that i wouldn’t really understand the problems
    which had been created by the head injury
  - and then, as soon as i smoked weed, they basically dropped me on
    my ass and withheld any future support, while knowing that i was
    incapable of really understanding how they had filled in the gaps
    before i graduated high school
  - and in combination with my restricting state of social isolation
    caused by information which is totally beyond my control and has
    left me without relationships,
    - especially any primary relationship that might develop into a
      stable spousal relationship, which usually “fills in the gaps”
      for people with aspergers
    - these and other relationships would have helped me
      psychologically develop

- i’ve been totally deprived of the types of experiences, which
  unconsciously force people to consciously reason about the things
  that make you more mature.
  - so then, people my age (and even younger) don’t want to deal with
    someone who hasn’t matured, especially in terms of how they
    process/react to interpersonal social interactions.
  - but then, i keep getting older and the probability of me being
    permitted into those experiences where i’ll actually learn to
    become more mature … it’s increasingly minimal, leaving me with
    NOTHING BUT PLATITUDES from people who pretend to “love” me and
    get a FREE PASS with zero criticism, since they are first degree
    family members.
  - and as long as they continue to isolate me by helping to virally
    spread negative beliefs about confidence in me (with regard to
    many things: work, life, relationships, family, etc) then no one
    will ever get close enough to me to discover what has happened,
    which is why i lash out on social media.
  - my life is nothing more than knee-deep bull shit.
  - and then everyone who controls me — who is apparently competent
    enough to socially isolate me and to keep me unconscious of the
    impacts their mistakes had on my psychology and my life — who is
    apparently plenty competent to employ intentional disruption and
    dirty handling tactics whenever i try to talk about the problems
    i’m dealing with — who never takes me seriously when i try to talk
    about problems with sociopaths at work — who have become the
    sociopathic, toxic people in my life — who actually are conscious
    enough to understand what they’re doing to me, since you can’t be
    so effective at it BY ACCIDENT
  - they get to say “I’m sorry, i’m too stupid to understand what your
    saying, David” … but guess what. that’s bullshit because you can’t
    do this by accident, assholes.

  - this is all in combination with the other personality complexes (&
    etc) that i shouldn’t have (which no one in my life acknowledges)
    - ① Superiority Complex
    - ② Inferiority Complex – Having both of these pushes people away
      constantly.
    - ③ Attachment Disorder – Perfect for ensuring social isolation!!
    - ④ PTSD – Nope, I’m not joking.
    - ⑤ Persecution Complex – The PTSD-inducing Trauma Practically
      Perpetuates Itself! PERFECT!!
    - ⑥ Abject Social Isolation and Stigma Management – Any shred of
      financial independence is undermined by sociopathic workplace
      bullies
    - ⑦ Repressed Memories – illegal to explain to me, ALLSO that it
      provokes Dissociative Identity Disorder, for which perhaps I am
      a mild case.
    - ⑧ Munchausen By Proxy via surveillance-empowered gaslighting


- why is it that no one takes me seriously with my insights into
  psychology, sociology, philosophy and etc?
  - why is it that, when i’m done writing, i will have published over
    1,000,000 on arguments to explain my experiences? …
    - … and critically, i generalize my experiences. so that hopefully
      i can help others avoid the traps/torment in life that i
      endured…
    - … so that my own suffering will not have been for nothing.
  - i have all but proven mathematically that there is no way to fix
    my life unless other people cooperate and admit what has happened
    to me.
    - yet what do they do? they pick the shortest paths every single
      time in dialogue, in arguments to try to paint me as insane…

      - and please understand that I see how it’s easy to look at my
        life and the things I post and reach that conclusion, but what
        you’re seeing is some serious victimization and
        marginalization.
        - you’re seeing the effects of social isolation on someone who
          (1) doesn’t give up (2) doesn’t really care that the floor
          is “lava”
          - (there is no such “rock bottom” when the suffering is
            EXTERNALLY IMPOSED)

    - but again, with focus on SOCIAL PHYSICS, people tend to pick the
      shortest paths every single time in dialogue with me,
      - to handle me generally, by playing stupid, by calling me out
        on any uncertainty, by counting on no one taking seriously
        someone who has cried wolf,
        -  by proactively pushing my buttons
          - (e.g. by referring to things connected to my own
            interpretations of traumatic memories WITHOUT EVER
            ACKNOWLEDGING THEM AS TRAUMA)
      - and the people who have the power to decide to help me change
        my life do this EVERY SINGLE TIME, without having to concede
        one step.
        - and they’re not socially disconnected, I AM. they have no
          confidence in my skills.
          - they never internalize information that i present to them
            NOR DO THEY EVER REPEAT IT
          - THIS by the way indirectly implies cognizance because you
            can ONLY run interference like this (without slipping up
            and accidentally conceding!!)
            - IF you are truly clueless and truly unconscious to my
              abuse and to the traumatic experiences i’ve experienced
              in life
          - however, if every single time, you manage to manipulate a
            highly intelligent person with high-functioning autism,
            without gradually conceding
            - then you don’t slip up because
            - (1) you know exactly what you are doing. you don’t make
              mistakes because you are dishonestly proceeding with
              almost every interaction that transgresses towards
              certain vulnerable areas OF WHICH YOU ARE COGNIZANT,
              which prompts you to proactively seek to push buttons in
              the son you know so well, since you have spent more time
              with that person in the past years than anyone
            - (2) this person is socially disconnected and doesn’t
              have the minimal amount of information it takes to draw
              conclusions
            - (3) they are terrible at successfully handling
              confrontation, since they have no social experience

    - and one more time: with emphasis on SOCIAL PHYSICS, people tend
      to pick the shortest paths every single time in dialogue with me
      - they apply statements/behaviors to any discussion which
        approaches subjects they know are vulnerable to convert them
        to situations which are non-threatening that they can win,
        preferably as close as possible to the agenda they want to
        push and as far as possible from their perceived
        vulnerabilities. for a single topic, you can’t repeatedly
        respond in similar ways 1,000 times by accident.
        - the reason for disruption to short-circuit real discussion
           (short circuit = shortest path) for specific topics is that
           people are cognizant of the consequences of fairly arguing
           with me. even more frustrating: they exploit my deficits of
           memory, which they blame on marijuana, but which really
           resulted from an early-childhood head injury and the
           resulting PDD-NOS diagnosis (that my mom seems to have
           cognizantly manipulated her way out of when i was a child,
           since if she rejected the neurologist’s opinion, then i
           wouldn’t have a leg to stand on later in life, as long as i
           didn’t really understand that i was different)
         - by the way, it took me at least three years (after finally
	remembering this diagnosis) to get my mother to admit that she
	remembered very clearly this appointment with a neurologist when i
	was ~10, discussion of which she short-circuits by intentionally
	referring to misnomers (e.g. repeatedly referring to unrelated
	events (e.g. she is intentionally playing stupid)
           - and yeh, i could be wrong about some of this (not all of
             it) but most critically WHY SO INTENTIONALLY
             SHORT-CIRCUIT ALL DISCUSSION?
           - it is like i have to plan these discussions like a lawyer
             plans on questioning a clever, evasive witness (where
             usually NO ONE witnesses the outcome or course of
             discussion, so it’s not like it matters anyways because
             my mom can simply ACT like nothing happened)

      - and their favorite tactic is to paint me as insane, which is
        usually an easy method to handle someone with, but not
        me. i’ll get to that in a second.
      - furthermore, i spent over a week in a short-term mental health
        institution, under 24/7 observation.
          - i never should have been sent to this facility and it very
            nearly cost me over $10,000 total!!
        - all for me to came out with a prescription for STRATERA.
      - despite the friendly and attentive nursing staff i encountered
         being friendly and attentive, the real problem i have with
         these facilities is that they are dehumanizing out of
         necessity for two reasons: (1) they want to minimize risk
         (e.g. no shoestrings for you, no you can’t have your kindle,
         and i hope you can translate that spanish bible with crayons)
         (2) they want the experience to be distinct from your
         environment, where you are restricted to behaviors with which
         you have more or less familiarity, so that they can read how
         you adapt to an unfamiliar environment, how you approach
         unfamiliar behaviors/activities, and make inferences about
         the aspects of life you seek but find missing in the
         restricted environment (3) they want to the experience to
         have positive, but also negative associations with it, so you
         want to leave and so you don’t want to go back

      - if i was whatsoever crazy, then the mental facility i went to
        IN RICHMOND (because they didn’t have enough Beds in Roanoke)
        would have forced me to take the meds they thought I needed.
        - and so let me tell you a little bit about this experience,
          which did absolutely nothing for me and disqualified me for
          military service, which i was actively exploring at the
          time, since it involves physical activity, free training in
          a new career and free college afterwards.
          - also, the ER staff who had me see a psychiatrist within 30
            minutes, ALSO HAD ORDERED X-RAYS!!!
            - i’m not sure, but this could have been ordered by a
              nurse on staff who had a personal connection to me
              - and may have known about a particular former piercing…
                and who administered the X-RAYS WITH ZERO EXPLANATION
            - regardless, i was charged for them and NO ONE LISTENED
              TO ME WHATSOEVER AT THE LEWIS GALE ER.
            - further, i was seen by a psychiatrist who clicked
              through the screens as fast as she could
              - and ONLY slowed down if it seemed like i was conceding
                information which would lead to a more severe
                hospitalization.
        - i had went into the E.R. presenting with MILD temporary
          psychosis induced by a bad formulation of adderall
  - i admit that I may not be correct about everything, but if i was
    actually delusional, it would be sooo easy to handle me.
    - AND IT IS NOT because i am correct about some very fucked up
      shit that has happened to me that I can prove.
      - so what is happening? people are trying to manage collateral
        damage to their own lives, but they don’t give a flying fuck
        about my mental health because if they did it would be so
        easy, right?
        - i mean, if i’m delusional, there’s a trail so long on my
          facebook profile that you can scroll for hours and never run
          out of shit that sounds crazy
        - but guess what? i’m not crazy. i’m not correct about 100% of
          what i complain about BECAUSE I DO NOT KNOW.
        - yet, that 10-20% of stuff that i am correct about? it is
          VERY fucked up and it means if you attempt to hospitalize
          me, EVERYTHING BACKFIRES
          - because you cannot lock me away in a facility where i
            can’t prove some of what has happened to me.

    - here’s the deal:
      - i scream about everything on Facebook and the only reason I do
        is because there’s no one to listen to me in my “support
        network”
        - which consists at the moment of a SINGLE 1º connection: my
          mother.
    - the problem with artificial isolation here is that it leaves a
      single-point-of-failure, so to speak, that indicates that there
      should have been one person who was very aware of the
      abuse/trauma that i went through.
      - and then that person would need to interface with a medical
        professional who would have to deal with my understanding of
        psychology/pharmacology/neurology (combined with the logistics
        of mental health) who would NEVER tolerate understanding what
        had happened to me, given that the one person who was most
        aware of it was my mother and also the person trying to cover
        much of her neglect/abuse up by throwing me away in the trash
        can labelled LOONEY BIN.

(move to top?)

- if you're on the other side, how do you develop HUMINT assets for
  future use who would ordinarily be loyal enough to betray their
  country?
  - if you're russia, and there's are target's you want to turn over a
    period of 2-3 years and you have SVR agents/assets who are in
    contact with networks from the other side, then they need
    cover. so they might present themselves ambiguously, but prefer to
    present themselves as agents of US. then, when the asset they're
    developing over the long-term gets burnt in a situation where the
    potential asset appears to have screwed things up, then that
    potential asset gets retaliated against by the US ... and thus,
    later turns. sometimes, this can be as simple as handing someone
    over to the Secret Police in America under false premises. who are
    the secret police in america? they’re the ones who police the
    secrets; every country has them. this might gradually cause
    someone to be tormented and their livelihood torn apart piece by
    piece where no one will ever concede anything, since no one can
    ever even talk about what that person was suspected of doing. so
    if they are falsely tormented and never allowed to understand why?
    it can create a self-perpetuating situation, especially if foreign
    intelligence risks egging it along, which is hard if someone is
    socially isolated.

- oh and that person who is falsely tormented and never knows why?
  they will NEVER be allowed to have a visible position of prominence
  in society. why? for many reasons, but most of all because with more
  social resources, it draws more attention to their torment. so that
  whole situation, regardless of their innocence or guilt, implies
  that person can never, ever be in a visible position … unless they
  are stupid enough to swallow whatever brainwashing pills they have
  to to sing like a little Mockingbird in a cage; that is, unless they
  allow themselves to be gaslit and brainwashed, so that they are a
  bird in a cage and eagerly repeat disinformation to help cover
  things up. yes, that means they will even be deranked on youtube and
  twitter forever LMAO. but seriously, you will never have a shot to
  do jack shit. why? because America doesn’t do that. that’s a very
  important component of strategy: it’s what we sell to people living
  in “democracy” so that we can produce people who are loyal
  assets. and it is critical for that: because the humanist
  ideals/values are what we sold people on to win the Cold War to make
  the West tolerate the bullshit we went through because it was way
  better than the utilitarian pragma of Communists.

however, we’ve lost those values. we no longer embody them. We embody
money/power, not necessarily for money/power itself, but maybe worse —
the average American doesn’t bother to consider WHY we should value
anything at all; we’re goaded by whatever rhetoric is necessary so
that we avoid understanding what really makes us tick. why? because
the average consumer is most profitable to the rich/powerful when they
are unconscious to the forces that filter/influence outcomes of
decisions.  the problem with this? it dumbs us down and makes us weak,
so we are easier to control, which works as long as we don’t see
long-term external threats. AND WE DON’T.

When these externalities begin to precipitate it’s easy for foreign
influence to push Americans around and goad them into social
conflict. then, in the very moments we have the ability to STOP those
external threats, we are instead at each other’s throats, leaving the
foreign influences which succeed the current american political
establishment plenty of loud, obnoxious factions to blame it on, like
all Communist and authoritarian movements are wont to do after
toppling a previously dominant or sovereign power. it gives them a set
of symbols/ideas to use to target vaguely associated networks of
people as a means to an end after conflict. simply corral present and
future enemies towards these symbols/ideas, label them as dissenting
and target them. voila! Communism 101 … well technically, it’s
post-revolutionary leninism 303, but it happens every single time.

- i am not your average paranoid joe ranting about shit. i have no
  time to be delusional. i can’t stand this dumb bullshit. i am tired
  of being deprived of information, which keeps me guessing and forces
  me to trust people luring me in with false promises of information
  to explain my suffering.
- i’m not experienced with intelligence, but i have a profound
  understanding of intelligence built out by a need to survive, after
  being subjected to these tactics.
  - between 2005-2007, i understood what Snowden revealed about NSA
    Surveillance in 2013.
- i have OPERATIONS-level understanding in intelligence. what does
  that mean? i understand things like:
  - (1) tactics used by foreign intelligence services to push out to
    build out future HUMINT resources by intersecting potential assets
    b/w networks of single & double agents. i.e. how to get your
    agents/handlers to make an omelette, even though somebody’s going
    to have to break an egg or two
  - (2) higher-level strategies for managing networks of assets, along
    with single/double/triple agents
  - (3) how the US responded at the start of the Cold War to address
    it’s own intelligence personnel deficiencies,
    - deficiencies in skill, built-out network and influence
      projection that lead to the Rosenberg’s getting information
      about the manhattan project leaked to Stalin

  - i watch CSIS videos on military/logistics for fun … i know,
    video’s, right?
  - i understand history, as it is, as it could have been, as i want
    it to be, as powerful people cannot afford it to be seen.
    - but most of all, i know how to use history as a pattern, limited
      only by my imagination, to model events in the past, present and
      future.
  - i have a 64gb kindle chock full of everything that i am interested
    in, including the entire curriculum taught in war colleges for
    generals in training.
    - i read books like the army intelligence and interrigation manual
      for fun … kinda. i read it to become aware of the tactics in
      case i run into things like them.
    - and understanding things like this has allowed me, WITH ZERO
      RESOURCES, to simultaneously be several steps ahead while i seem
      several steps behind
      - in ways that people don’t understand/anticipate because
        - (1) incredibly flawed psychological analysis based on
          disinformation generated by a rumor-mill running at full
          steam
        - (2) they do not anticipate what i know about what they do;
          - nor can they comprehend HOW i know what i know;
          - but further they cannot model my own patterns of
            intelligence, which extend as many of their models as i
            can learn, which is what i have done methodically, to
            survive
        - (3) they overestimate my vulnerability, mistake my silence
          for ignorance and my rash reactions as those of someone who
          has run out of cards to play.
          - and let me get one thing real straight here: I DO NOT WANT
            TO PLAY PETTY GAMES. i want someone to apologize to me, so
            that i can know other people who might target me have an
            example to remind them OFFICIALLY of what to be afraid of.
