### [What The Pwnies?!](#what-the-pwnies)

If you wanted to correct a problem, you would give someone the chance
to say something about it -- e.g. one on one; mono e mono; a fucking
conversation. If you wanted to create problems, so you can pretend
your fear of "Nazi's riding dinosaurs" is justified, then you would do
exactly what has been done. You needed to create the enemy because the
enemy was not actually there. Further, you needed to overcome hurdles
imposed by your *political rivals* pushing back in a democracy against
expensive liberal policies which were required.

All your babes are belong to us, for "experiments" of course. It
serves you right, doesn't it? And if you really believed in what you
did, you wouldn't said a word about it would you? See? The explanation
checks an awful lot of boxes, although it really has zero factual
basis. You'll have all the papers you need, no one will be able to
tell the difference. And NO, you'll children nor your children's
children will EVER be permitted to have anything of significance, nor
will anyone be the wiser as to why so many of their lives are
miserable.

### ["La démocratie" -- c'est une idée ironique, n'est-ce pas?](#la-democratie-cest-une-idee-ironique)

By the way, the 51st state is not going to be Puerto Rico. It was
never even up for debate -- well, technically it was. That's what the
Deep State does: they control everything. Everything is and, since
WW2, as always been a very complicated facade, albeit a democracy --
*TECHNICALLY*. It's that way, for a reason: because it's probably best
that the masses don't drag us down to economic collapse and thence
rears that damnably invulnerable hydra communism.

The point is not that democracy is inherently flawed. Instead the
point is that democracy without free press where unchecked
disinformation floods minds with fervorous rancor isn't democracy at
all. It's simply a facade, which actually serves the interests of the
elite more often than it protects the interests of the
people.

Basically, I'm saying -- want a democracy? **GO TO SCHOOL, PROTECT
WHISTLEBLOWERS AND MAKE SURE CNN DOESN'T RUN THE SHOW**. But when you
don't do that, the economy will destabalize. What results is a descent
into ignorance, poverty and leninism -- which is one fantastic reason
the American's kept the Nazi's on such a short leash for all this
time, as long as those ignorant Nazi shits can keep their racism in
check. Why is it fantastic? Because if there's one thing Nazi's hate
more than anything else, it's communists.

That's our ace in the hole, in case Communism is released in
America. The only reason that would even happen is if the Federal
Reserve can't keep their shit under control.

Guess who has all the legal keys to this, by the way. It's Donald
J. Trump. His family is connected to all of it and that's partially
what the Anna Nicole Smith case was about: could any of their seized
property even incidentally fall outside the strict control of
[OAPC](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Office_of_Alien_Property_Custodian).

And if I ain't Trump's uncle -- his uncle was the Alien Property
Custodian! And now you know what all of this shit is *potentially*
about, by the way. It's about *domineering* the historical narrative
of post-WW2 history, for whatever reason. I can't actually say.

Anyways, no, we do not actually want Nazi's riding on dinosaurs, but
if I had to choose between diversity-rainbow "not-Nazi's" on ponies
using civic nationalism in America and this chaotic Leninist
engineered collapse that will damn america's economy for a century,
leaving the singularity squarely in the hands of those Goddamn
sychophantic leninists, I would choose the Mu "not-nazi's" in less
time than it takes my heart to beat one more time. And is it racist?
*HELL NO, YOU DUMB MOTHERFUCKERS. THIS IS ABOUT AMERICA.*

#### One Such Diversity Rainbow Not-Nazi The Leninists Just Wouldn't Let You See, So You Couldn't Stop the Inevitable Collapse

![WHAT THE PWNIES?!!]()

What the fuck was that fetus thing anyways? Have you ever horizontally
flipped the "Coon and Friends" Logo? Fuck those assholes. You want an
economy? You want prosperity where America's collective, multi-ethnic
fate is NOT determined by our enemies? Do you remember how
anti-American their narratives are? *YOU WANT THAT TO BE YOUR
FUTURE?!* Really? **That** shit is *cray*.

**Pick one:** either the Project for a New American Century
successfully guarantees that we hang on to power ... or there is
systemic economic collapse that degrades into *IRONIC COMMUNISM*, the
very worst type of the worst form of government. Either one, can we
please not become a giant nation of racist assholes? Because diversity
really is America's greatest strength in a 21st century economy by the
way.
