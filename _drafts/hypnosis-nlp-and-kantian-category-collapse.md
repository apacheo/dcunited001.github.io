- there's already a ton of study on meditative states of mind, but i
  believe this provides a neuroanatomical basis for more mystical or
  spirital concepts like prana, kundalini and "energy" flows
  - but it seems that controlling/channeling the flow of spinal,
    cranial and cognitive neural impulses can cause altered flows of
    information/energy within the nervous system that would otherwise
    be rare.
  - e.g. diminished flow via efferent nerves may cause the brain/mind
    to tune into input from afferent nerves.
  - e.g. diminished flow in the DMN and brain regions active in
    cognitive may trigger decentralized crosstalk b/w neurons

# What is NLP?

    NLP terms (interesting bc inaccessible. turns out to be good)

### Modalities/Submodalities

- [submodalities](https://www.nlpworld.co.uk/nlp-glossary/s/submodalities/)

- hacking sensory inputs.
  - particularly, those related to the "lizard brain"
    - mimicking sensory input effectively triggers to unconsciously
      trigger signals deeper within the brain

- tonal system
  - using emotional tones of voice/action to signal:
    - in phase with the expected response,
    - randomly, against expectation
    - neutrally
    - counter to the specifically expected emotional response
    - with some pattern of behavior designed to "fake out" the
      counter-party's [n-gram](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/N-gram)
      - an N-gram is the next N moves you predict the counter-party to
        make. for NLP (natural language processing), it is the next N
        words you expect someone to say.
      - it's used on the iPhone to suggest words, given a partial seq
      - but it's the sequence of symbols representing the next moves
        you expect an adversary to make
        - if you sufficiently generalize this concept, you can apply
          it in a cold, cruel, utilitarian way that would give stalin
          a boner by manipulating your counter-party's sequence of
          emotions/actions/etc
        - remember, you naturally win because you gain/maintain their
          trust while drawing out their desire to want/need a
          connection,
          - yada yada yada.
          - excuse me while i fucking barf.
      - SCIENTOLOGY LITERALLY IS TEAM SOCIOPATHY

  - when you decouple your emotional state by composing patterns of
    the above in response to the natural emotional states of others,
    it forces them to be reactive
    - this is an abuse of an authentic social connection. most people
      want to be in phase with you, but you can alter your behavior to
      consistently give yourself an advantage by exploiting the
      needs/desires of others to feel an authentic emotional
      connection
      - in a cold, utilitarian way, this usually gives you the upper
        hand.
      - i never do this on purpose; i simply lack the ability to form
        emotional connection via like 8 different personality
        complexes, including an attachment disorder

# Hypnosis, NLP and Conceptual Designation

During the mind's infancy, there is a state of tabula rasa, but
parents have focused love, nutrition, intent and planning into the
child for nine months or longer already. Anything is possible, but the
brain's structure already exists.

- beginning life as tabula rasa
  - accumulation of residue
  - elimination of this residue
    - first, you need to be aware of this residue's presence
    - you have to stimulate these buttons being pressed
      - and gradually condition alternative reponses to be stronger
      - however, the risk is that triggering these stimuli makes the
        unwanted responses even stronger.
  - remapping the residue

### Conditioning of Conceptual Designation Leads to a Distracted Mind

  - also, people who i feel like used hypnotis or NLP techniques,
    would condition me with stimuli that distracted my focus and
    layered meaning onto stimuli.
    - (this is like layering in emphasis onto stimuli and conditioning
      the mind to divert its energy in particular ways)
    - if they actually were doing this, they could then trigger my
      cognitive processes to react to specific imagery and types of
      sensory experience.
    - they could cause my mind to change the quality of cognitive
      activities. it causes your mind to be triggered into utilizing
      different neurological modalities (a term which NLP references
      heavily)
    - it can be incredibly distracting, especially if you have ADD or
      aspergers
    - for example, in context of the expression "he pushed my
      buttons", NLP is like how you create those buttons.
      - you can then subtly trigger someone to begin thinking about
        specific imagery or trigger brief emotional states that the
        person becomes more likely to re-express in the short-term
    - if so, it's interesting how these techniques are kind of like
      *the opposite* of gradually shedding conceptual designation in
      that they condition you to create artificial constructs
    - and if someone did this intentionlly and surreptitiously, this
      seems a bit ... mean. and like not just mean. it seems like
      something you might see in a silence of the lambs movie. like
      something the serial killer character could and would do to
      people.
      - and it requires so much forethought, plenty of regular contact
        with the subject/target, and *constant* focus on the malicious
        intent of bringing harm to that person.
      - "Anthony Hopkins uses NLP to butter his victims up. Be like
        Hopkins"

### Hypnosis Accelerates Deposition of Residual Potential for Conceptual Designation

- The [monkey mind]()

- the story in "Isis Unveiled" about someone walking along, who freaks
  out seeing snake on the road, but on closer inspection, it's just a
  stick lying in the road.
  - this is about the tendency of the unconscious and subconscious
    elements of the human mind to misclassify input, without enough
    information.

  - when you deprive people of social signal or sensory signal, it can
    cause these same unconscious & subconscious elements to run in
    overdrive.
    - classifying visual signal w/ limited information is especially
      taxing. this exploits
      [Kantian Category](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Category_(Kant))
      "collapse" which is similar to the wavefunction collapse. Before
      the mind has imbued its experience w/ conceptual designation for
      particular social, sensory or semiotic signal, the brain must
      expend a lot of energy and chaotically divert its energy to
      acquire enough information to trigger the Kantian collapse. It
      triggers turbulence in neural energetic flows.

### Modeling Disruption-Specific Hypnotic Techniques With Continuum Mechanics

- With hypnosis specifically geared towards disruption (especially
  COINTELPRO) the goal is to identify lower and higher-order signals
  that cause displacement and deformation of the target's projection
  of attention/focus
  - in other words, when the target is making progress towards a goal
    you want them to stay away from or prevent them from accomplishing
    progress on, then you simply distract their attention or focus

- TOOD: explain more about displacement/deformation of attention
  (still more)
  - physical deformation of attention/focus on visual/spatial data
    - visually, one can wide the set of objects the mind focuses on,
      so that attention expands, facilitating conscious thought about
      objects that are closer to the outside of the visual field
      - this expansion of focus in the visual field corresponds to
        deformation of the aperture of attention on the visual sense
    - turning your head and moving your eyes, causes the mind to react
      by anticipating the objects & phenomena that it will encounter
      visually.
  - our attention isn't confined to visual phenomena though, as we can
    redirect our mind's activity towards objects from various scales
    of memory, to completely abstract ideas, etc
  - However, attention, its plasticity and its intensity are all
    limited resources. These are psychologically, neurologically,
    genetically bound resources.
    - some people's attention is indefatiguable -- you can throw
      anything at it and they'll never waver one bit.
    - other people have attention that is more susceptible to sensory
      disruption. people with Asperger's and various degrees of autism
      can be easily disrupted by sensory stimulus. it's why i know
      that the people who've psychologically abused me *KNEW* how to
      use my psychology against me -- which begs the question: how the
      fuck did they have access to this information in like 2011?

- an approach to modeling attention/focus inspired by deformation and
  displacement from continuum mechanics
  - over various time-scales, the mind is mapped onto it's mental
    construction of both the physical/logical world
    - attention or focus can be imagined as this mapping.
    - as you read a book, you are mapping your mind to the words in
      the book, but first you must map your visual field to the words
      on the page of the book. the words in the book allow you to
      assemble mental constructs representing the semantic intent of
      the author.
    - unfortunately, your model of the semantic intent of the author
      is extremely temporal in nature. the longer you maintain those
      images in your mind, the stronger the resultant impact on the
      structure of your mind.
      - part of the problem with the internet and immediate access to
        all information is that the target of focus toggles too
        rapidly for the images consumed to set into the mind.
        - because people are constantly task-switching, we are cutting
          against the neurological grain of our mind, so to speak. by
          rapidly switching the object of our focus *NOTHING* sets
          into our minds.
        - this is something that cannot be addressed by the nature of
          technology. it is a problem that can only be address at the
          user interface level -- by changing the nature of the
          presentation of informartion.
      - you do not study by reading 5 minutes of one subject, 5
        minutes of another subject and cycling through many different
        subjects at short intervals. why? it is not effective. why?
        because the longer you spend focusing your mind intently on
        one thing the more quickly and readily it begins to set into
        your mind.

  - however, if your intent is to disrupt someone writing or perhaps
    reading a book, there are several dependencies in the mental
    process to write/read that can be disrupted in order to disrupt
    the higher-order task. if this is done successfully, it cannot be
    easily be stated whether anything external to the target acted
    upon the target.
    - garbage in, garbage out: all you need to do is get an open
      channel to the target's mind. unfortunately, the human mind is a
      product of biological evolution and still has many of the
      extrinsic dependencies of biological existance including open
      and unsecured channels of sensory input.
    - so, these people harness the division between the "lizard brain"
      and the "mammalian brain" by utilizing high-intensity sensory
      signals. this division can be leveraged because the more primal
      instincts of the lizard brain -- think "fight or flight" --
      *ALWAYS* take precedence over the higher-order functions of the
      mammalian brain.
      - we have been conditioned by hundreds of millions of years to
        react to specific kinds of high-intensity sensory imagery.
      - if nothing else, presenting someone with high-intensity sounds
        or visual imagery breaks their train of thought. these
        "breaks" are reflected within the mind neurologically -- your
        mind must reorient itself to deal with what the "lizard brain"
        perceives as a potential threat.
      - this "reorientation" can be provoked by *ANY* high-intensity
        sensory signals and *breaks* your focus. because the mammalian
        brain is built on top of the lizard brain, it is like having
        ground shift from underneath you. the intensity of these
        visual signals causes the disruption to emerge from the Id up
        through the subconscious. Because it emerges from the
        subconscious, the consciousness is not aware of the source if
        it's attention/focus problems. i hate these people. they
        deserve to die.

- fortunately, its fairly easy to detect when people are *intending*
  to do this to someone, which is why the CIA always seeks to pull you
  away from social contact while they do it to you.
  - it's hilarious the lengths they will go through to do this to
    someone behind closed doors. once you understand the hoops they
    jump through to do this to someone at a "black site" it can be
    effectively defused because the logistics are easy to recognize.
  - of course, they try to brainwash you while they do it -- that's
    half the intent anyways. then, if anyone is capable of asking
    serious questions about it without being threatened themselves,
    the CIA just acts like they were "training" you, even though they
    were hostile and malicious the whole time. if anything they were
    planning on using you as a disposable asset to catch the burn.

- why i get the fuck away from anyone doing this hypnotic bullshit:
  all they need is an open channel to your senses. moreover, these
  clowns are impossible to distinguish from the harmless "random
  person" and if you become privy to what they do, most people are
  rendered helpless paranoid of everything that moves. for being such
  a minority of society, the social scale of psychological carnage
  these assholes reap upon America cannot be understated. they all
  deserve to die. anyone who intends to weaponize hypnosis upon
  unwitting people in casual life deserves to die.
  - Why not face your problems head on *like you actually have a
    fucking spine?* (oh, it's because they don't)
  - fortunately, these people are easy to identify using a combination
    of facial recognition and social physics. in small towns, they
    stick out like sore thumbs.

### Hypnotic Conditioning to Encourage Negative Behavior Patterns or Evasive Stimulus Respons

- really needs to be combined with CBT techniques and distortion of
  the target's "values compass" with deprivation of positive
  reinforcement, unless the target is cooperating with the conditioned
  behaviors, in which case, you artificially increase the positive
  reinforcement
