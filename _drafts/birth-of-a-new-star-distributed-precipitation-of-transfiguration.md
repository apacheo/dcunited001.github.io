title: "Birth of a New Star: Distributed Precipitation For Transfiguration"
---

- Figures like Steve Jobs: where do they come from?
  - Are people born great or do they become great?
  - Or perhaps the seeds of greatness are gradually deposited within
    vessels, which are tested and measured.
  - Once the deserving vessels have been sufficiently stress-tested
    against all the factors in corporate or political life that could
    lead to their downfall, then the deposition of information inside
    these (strong) vessels is accelerated.


- the right set of people leverage suggestion/etc to implant the right
  set of information into people as sociophysical containers
  - the goal is to do this in a decentralized manner so that it
    becomes difficult to causally trace the myriad sources of
    information
  - the person who is borne of such a process will want to believe
    that their actions speak to their merit, especially if they become
    someone who is incredibly successful like Steve Jobs.
    - the people who look up to their hero will also want to believe
      that their hero's intrinsic qualities, vision and hard work are
      alone responsible for their success.
      - who wants to believe anything else? it's a bit depressing to
        see behind the curtain of illusions here because it means our
        heros are a little more illusory than we realize.
      - their successes are primarily the result of "reality
        distortion fields" that are meticulously managed by (people)
        around them who are dependent on the success of these great
        men, for whatever reason.


- this "great man" becomes positioned (just right) in academia/industry,
  - they are threaded and intertwined into a network of people. the
    probabilities are amplified that specific social connections will
    be made over short or long time-scales, all without seeming
    forced.
  - As that (candidate) absorbs additional (informational salinity) --
    especially as that knowledge relates to poorly understood trends
    critical to society in the near future -- this distinguishes them
    from their colleagues as a (more-deserving) candidate

- (it is the knowledge they absorb that drives the development of
  their vision). Perhaps, it precipitates serendipitously through
  their life experience. (Maybe the deconstructed knowledge is
  intentionally disseminated to them in decentralized fashion.)
  - regardless, it's this accumulation of precipitated knowledge --
    coupled with their ability to leverage it to extrapolate an
    unparalleled vision -- that is required (starting material) for
    their transfigurational catalyzation into greatness.

- academic institutions as sociophysical breeding grounds for the
  exchange and fermentation of knowledge.
  - the probablities of the right connections being made between
    intellectual people increase dramatically, as do the probabilities
    of myriad types of events that can only occur between people with
    sufficient levels of knowledge, especially that specific to a
    field of study.
  -

- (if done correctly) it appears the people who deposited the salt of
  their success and measured the strength of this vessel of salt
  weren't involved at all.

  - (this) is all but meaningless when the average person knows the
    truth and can be detrimental to the great man's ego, whose passion
    is often fueled by the perspective and light wherein they've
    chosen to frame their merits.

- but (if this is so..) why bother?
  -

# The Great Man's Reality Distortion Field

- (maybe remove) behind every great man is a sociophysical machine
  (and a myserious man with a very salty bottle of awesome sauce)
- the great man stands at the help of a sociophysical machine.
  - Steve jobs quote: "looking forward & looking back, connect the
    dots"
  - the great man is also a product of a complex niche, a complex
    demand that the world needs filled.
  - even if the world rids themselves of the man, they can't so easily
    destroy the fated niche

- (segue?) this all happens while the great man is surrounded by a reality
  distortion field, sets of self-perpetuating sociophysical dynamics
  that feed their own propagation. these reality distortion fields can
  be either negative or positive. when they are postive, all
  sociophysical encumbrances are magically lifted from that persons
  path, as though palms are being layed down at their feet. the great
  man's path ahead is known and people seek to curry favor by clearing
  the way and diffusing the sociophysical energy of anything that
  could be perceived as a threat.
  - in the extreme, this reality distortion field becomes a kind of
    cult of personality.

#### Really, who the fuck thinks like that? Is that realistic?

  - when the reality distortion field is negative, the person is
    thrown in a hole. if they ever appear to climing their way out,
    their path is ascertaind and they encounter constant blocking,
    until they can be thrown in a whole. it's not clear to me who
    could possibly harbor such negative intent in their hearts as to
    constantly react to someone's meager successes, while
    simultaneously transforming the required sociophysical energy to
    destroy that target's life every single time they manage to make
    it out of their sociophysical jail.
  - the average person never sees this and, if they did, they are not
    intelligent enough to understand it for what it is. if they begin
    to see it as it is, then someone else can easily pull the wool
    over their eyes and lay them back down to sleep.
    - i'm writing about this as a victim of a perpetual negative
      reality distortion field, but i still can't quite believe that
      it would be so critical to a handful of people, such that they
      seek to destroy my life forever. literally, it sounds so insane
      and only takes a couple hundred thousand words to explain. nor
      is it actually health to wake up and undrestand what's
      happening. but i've had to invent my own philosophical ideas
      based on extensions of social phsyics to even explain what's
      happening. it's too bad that people need 160 IQ's and a master's
      degree understanding of like six fields to understand what I'm
      saying. There's literally no hope for me. I'm writing for myself
      and other victims like me. Mostly, I'm writing for people in the
      future, so that after social physics becomes quantifyable,
      people understand what happened to me and others like me.

### (This is literally a curse)


  - in the occult, this negative reality distortion field is a kind of
    curse. like a black magic the gathering card, it requires
    consistent upkeep costs. people must transmute sociophysical
    potential energy into its more kinetic form to continue to ascribe
    the information onto my identity that holds me down.
    Unfortunately, social media has made this much easier. Social
    physics lacks equilibrium dynamics, so this alchemic transmutation
    is done properly -- and crucially, I'm never allowed to escape my
    cage to tell my story -- then people *gain* sociophysical energy
    by doing so, as long as they interact with my life utilizing the
    proper karmic obfuscation.
    - another way to think about this is in terms of Scientology:
      you're constantly burdened by thetans, information forms which
      are associated with your identity. Intentionally doing this to
      someone parallels witchcraft.


  - (this) is quite often the result of someone's "beyond the grave"
    kind of plan, which is typical for certain secret societies.
    - they like to demonstrate their ability to envision, design and
      precipitate (happenings) over impossibly long time-scales,
      whereby demonstrating this ability to do seems unimaginable.
    - such plans must be designed and calculated in secret, for
      otherwise, all great plans are easily defeated.


###


- how does this make sense from a nietzschean perspective?
  - it gives other people hero's who seem to have ascended beyond the
    limits of normal life in a very supernatural or extraordinary way.
  - their followers become obsessed with details of these great men's
    lives that are critical towards constructing the great man's
    specific Herculean narrative
  - by viewing these people as extraordinary as a consequence of their
    own merits alone, the public at large is given hope that there is
    a way to transcend the depressing limitations of life.
    - they are given a kind of north star for ideal traits and
      experience required to imitate, if one is to transcend the
      limiations of life
      - this star is always just out of their reach. If these men are
        the product of a distributed, decentralized effort to create
        them, then such stars are definitively out of reach for every
        man who might want to individually imitate them.
      - however, by trying to imitate these stars held up on pedestals
        by society as radiant examples of the transformation of the
        sublime and ordinary into greatness, we all reach a little
        higher than we ordinarily would.
      - therefore, even though these stars are impossibly out of reach
        for the average person, their existance is in accordance with
        the (platonic directive) that myth should be fashioned to
        artificially amplify virtuous behavior and heroic actions
        - this platonic directive for myth is why disney stories
          always have a good ending. good always triumphs over evil in
          disney stories. this is in spite of the reality: good
          doesn't always triumph over evil, but people will imitate
          the values encoded in their myths and stories. So if good
          might triumph over evil or the ordinary might be
          transfigured into the great -- if only they struggled as
          hard as they could -- then myth can act as a means of
          distributing this desire to struggle for the triumph of
          justice and virtue in society.
  - without holding these heroes up on pedestals, it becomes less
    clear to people, especially adolescents, which virtues and traits
    they should imitate. worse, they don't know the specific kinds of
    greatnes they should strive for or that they could realistically
    expect to attain in life.
    - we should hope that every person has plenty of these kind of
      stars to look up to, especially while they are young. otherwise
      some fault in our stars will cause the youth to become
      disillusioned and thereby demoralized. society should emphacize
      the values it chooses to judge us by. moreover, the demographics
      of adolescent and young adults should be strongly connected to
      their younger counterparts to provide good examples for them to
      imitate.
    - in order for such mechanisms to function, a society must have
      justice and the right things should happen to the right people.
      - this means justice in the sense of legal justice, but also
        justice in the sense of social justice.
      - when social interactions become artificially warped around the
        attainment of some ideology's goals, then the sense that there
        is justice in society is detrimentally affected, in each the
        legal and social senses of justice, among others.
- how do we all know how to be collectively greater than we are now?
  if every individual strives to imitate their heroes, then then
  collectively we all evolve to become greater. systematically
  undermine how our heroes appear to the common person and we will
  generally foment demoralization. This is happening now. Both the
  left and the right are encouraging people to distrust their
  heroes. Fake news and real news is undermining our trust in those
  who've been held up for so long. Those stars are dwindling and
  burning out, whose traits, experiences and triumphs we should all
  struggle to imitate -- despite the reality that not everyone can
  succeed so fantastically.
