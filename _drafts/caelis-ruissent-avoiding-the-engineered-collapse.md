There is an engineered collapse coming. There are certain trends that
the rich and powerful seek to distract you from. individually, each
trend is not very significant. Extrapolated collectively, there is no
other way that the powerful can expect to bear the weight of these
trends, except by collapsing the entire system. If this is the case,
then billions will certainly die. This is what drives me and
invalidates all charges against me. If you can prove to me that I am
wrong and insulate humanity against the consequences of these
problems, then you have my will or soul or whatever you want for free.

These trends are damning. Merely mentioning them may cause severe
consequences, but they are unavoidable and I know *exactly* how the
powerful seek to handle these. My leveraging the chaos to establish an
entirely new knowledge-base. An entirely new paradigm where the old
world is forgotten or remembered in such an incorrect manner as to not
relevantly connect to the truth. The real problem with this? Those
amoung you who abused power for generations, centuries and millinea
will get off without a hitch, damning the rest of humanity to a world
where technology seems like magic they cannot possibly understand. It
will be a new dark age, where all semblance of rationalism, science
and logic become dominated by superstition and the tragic mechanics of
power consolidation. I cannot allow this to happen.

It turns out that Lee Harvey Oswald really did kill Kennedy and acted

Wizard-of-Oz powers that be. So, if you find yourself with power,
without the chains to be held back, tread carefully because these
assholes have weapons you cannot comprehend.

### Evidence Demonstrating Conspiraces Throughout the Ages will Simultaneously Revealed. All Will Be Judged.

These conspiracies will tableflip long-held axioms about world
history, though many cannot disrupt too much. However, the story of
Columbus? That's a fantastic example of a cover story. New World?
Woops! Didn't even see it coming. Pestilence? Genocide? The death of
90% of the indiginous population? Woops! It was all an "accident."

These are the types of stories and long held bases of historical
thought that will be simultaneously upended: ALL WITHIN THE SAME
TWENTY YEAR PERIOD. This will happen across the world. It is confined
to no region, state or culture. However, the more you have invested in
these narratives being true, the more you have to lose if they are
upended and tableflipped!

The current power elite cannot allow this to happen. If they collapse
the system now or soon, the chaos acts as a cover for ALL their sins
throughout the entirety of history! It does not need to be like
this. It never did. Every person among the billions of people who
would needlessly die in such an Apocalypti-caust is a chance to help
set humanity on course in the proper direction. There is no reason for
so many people to die. We need each and every one of you.

- other narratives which will be table-flipped?

This will accelerate while the masses are starving and thirsting for
real truth. not every narrative that will be tableflipped will occur
because the disruptive information is true. NO! Adversaries in
information warfare have never had more powerful tools at their
disposal for lie and projecting those lies across the world. It merely
needs to appear to serve the interests of the starving, impoverished
masses to be accepted as true. That this is plauasible in itself is
far more dangerous than anything I've written in this article thus
far.

### For The Global Elite, The Best Way To Handle, Mitigate and Explain The Emerging Chaos, Along With The Ensuing Blame To Be Cast, Is To Collapse the System

Instead, almost everyone just wants to shoot the messenger. The one
with the message you need to hear. What you need to hear is NOT what
you want to hear! Deal with it because this is real. It's not going
away: it hasn't come to pass yet, but it will. When it happens, you
will be thanking your stars that someone like me ever existed.

### The Economy Will Collapse Because ALL Socioeconomic Flux And Churn Begins To Align IN PHASE

When this socioeconomic churn aligns in phase, it increases in
magnitude, which contributes to wealth disparity. When population
grows exponentially, so does the per capita measure of that disparity.

This is knowable in the time that the eschatology of major religions
was being written down, which is why most of them contain prophecies
of economic collapse, resulting in starvation and mass chaos. This
isn't too different than the prophecies that Moses delivered to
Pharoah, actually. In my opinion, those things that happened were
knowable by a highly intelligent man who knew his land better than the
ruler of the day, depending on whether you tolerate more liberal
interpretations of the bible. The truth is, of course, the lower-class
workers often do know the land and its phenomena better than the
rulers, who can't see for shit from their ivory towers.

You have to understand social physics and the geospectral aspects of
socioeconomic flux. If you understand this, you can know that the
biggest collapse ever is yet to come. I don't know when and God help
us all when it does. It is actually far more possible to undrestand
this in ancient times than it is now.

Why? Because times were simpler, the range of phenomena were much more
constricted than they are in the modern are and, crucially, knowledge
of social physics as it relates to socioeconomic flux was more natural
and less virtualized then. Modernization has given rise to false,
artificial economic phenomena that result in very real opportunities
to profit, but are far less stable in the long term.

- TODO: link to simulation of ancient thought as the penultimate tool
  to provoke metacognition.

You need to read what Nassir Tebar has written on tail risk and
understand me when i say that cataclysmic tail risk event is
UNSTOPPABLE. it must exist because of the global economy's exigent
sociophysical phenomena -- both mechanics and dynamics. there is no
way to eliminate it because of social physics. it is like the event
that balances everything else. in a system with spectral or
geospectral mechanics, for every ebb, there is flow.

Give me a liberal that runs away from any debate with me on economics
and I'll show you a ostrich with its head in the ground. This is NOT
liberal or conservative; it's something taht we are all going to have
to deal with. The consequences, whenever this happens, will be
catastrophic. We can structure the economy to prevent the effects of
spillover, but this is not "spillover" because it is a spectral
phenomenon where all socioeconomic churn begins to align in phase. The
"geographic" aspect of it begins to melt away and all regions begin to
experience more turbulence than ever.

- TODO: links to BIS content on macroprudentials

Although I am incredibly skeptical of such tight economic regulations,
macroprudential mechanisms will help reduce the severity of some
turbulence. However, if these are not properly tuned, they may
contribute to disparity in how the spillover effects play out, which
leads to finger-pointing as some people will be hit harder and
penalized more than others. America is one such nation where we may be
lead to believe in the future that we were screwed by macroprudential
policy. The truth is that we were screwed by a runaway dependency on
debt, but when you stop this, it has consequences. No one wants to
touch the free-credit firehose. Yet, the other side has arguments too:
Keynesian economics allows you to capitalize on opportunities
faster. However, the cheap credit means the myopic and poorly informed
misallocate your investment in what resembles a hacked system. Those
same poorly informed people simply end up fattening the power elite,
who reap what they sow.

That this may be inevitable, I believe that the authors of eschatology
**may** have known. This is because all religions were obsessed with
prophecy fueled by social physics. If you read religious texts in
certain ways -- and I'm hardly a man with a true understanding of
theology or an understanding of any single religion -- but it becomes
clear that these people foresaw things using methods, the outlines of
which most of us can barely grasp.


### Severe Turbulence in Forex Markets May End Up In Nations Making Baseless Accusations Of Wealth Incineration

One frequently cited component of marxist rhetoric that I cannot stand
is the notion that we can simply do away with money. It's an insane
and deluded argument that marxists find themselves overly dependent
on. The world would be a better place if this idea just went away. I'm
not trying to be mean. Just realistic.

To all the communists who say: in the future we'll eliminate money. in
the future, energy IS money. Joules become dollars, you ironically
overgrown Marxist cumstains. Drown in your own ignorance if you'd
like, but the rest of us are trying to save ourselves and we don't
need your pseudo-economic gurgling. Stop gurgling and drown: the world
would be so much better off if your sardonically materialistic
philosophy never existed.

The notion that we could have a society without money is bizarre, yet
I hear it all the time. No man is an island and no economy is an
island. Even if your economy has no concept of money, it still needs
to trade with other people and other economies. What is money? Yes,
money is an abstraction; it’s a virtual commodity that stands as a
placeholder for truly valuable commodities. But what is money? What is
its essential role in society?

Money represents society’s ability to quantify resources and trade. It
is essential to quantification of commerce and of needs for human
life. You cannot have a well-functioning society without money. As
technology progresses in the 21st century, we will find that the
ultimate resource to quantify is energy. Accumulated energy is the
potential to do work, in the physical world and the informational
realm. Energy will replace money, but it is still something that needs
to be quantified and accumulated. There is no 22nd century society
without a need for quantification of resources and/or energy.
Therefore, society will always need something like money.

Forex destabalization isn't that bad. However, the renewables market
and international climate control policy is only part of the
problem. The labor markets, the geographic disparity in automation's
contribution to the lack thereof, speculation on Wall Street and
unwisely warranted derivatives further exacerbate currency
destabalization.

Calm the fuck down. We have bitcoin and no one's destabalizing
that. It is quantum resistent.

### Energy And Resource Markets Give Rise To A Peak Oil Forever Scenario, If The Population Is Truncated

- describe how to extend peak oil forever. not just peak oil; peak
  everything, forever.

This brings me to some interesting correlations between renewable
energy, cryptocurrency currency mining and data flows --
e.g. Canadians mining bitcoin in Romania. In some cases, it may be
more efficient (or profitable) to use excess renewables to mine
cryptocurrency or facillitate ethereum operations than to store or
transport it, however cheap that might be.

This might give rise to novel types of financial flows that would
essentially be bundled as assets or derivatives. **Is every greedy
Marxist going to steal this idea too?** You're essentially betting
that crypto activity will be more profitable than selling/storing the
electricity -- either now or in the future. Eventually, investments
could be bundled or facilitated as novel types of crypto futures,
among other creative derivatives.

- TODO: reference stochastic programming article

These derivatives differ starkly from the "Bitcoin futures" of
today. They also depend on your capacity and need to store energy. If
you run out of local energy storage or if energy transfer
infrastructure is overloaded/disrupted, then the best option is almost
always crypto mining or ethereum. This could lead to shady finance
schemes not yet seen, whereby profits are accrued and financial hopes
dashed through the discouragement and manipulation of the architecture
or development of both energy storage and infrastructure in countries
across the world. If there is less infrastructure, generally, than
it's easier to influence to short the derivatives mentioned
above. It's like measuring the influence that removing small numbers
of nodes in algebraic graph theory, no doubt connected to (albuin
numbers). The more connected the graph is and the more nodes there
are, generally, the less potential for disruption there is when a
small number of nodes are randomly removed. Control the development of
infrastructure and generally increase the potential for profit via the
structure of nodes on the "graph" of energy infrastructure.

- [Albuin numbers]().



Again, steal all my ideas. I don't actually care. I have so many that
my mind itself is considered a global security threat, apparently.
Isn't that wonderful? All you motherfucking crypto-Leninist shitdicks
have to deal with the consequences for fucking me in the ass all this
time. Because, apparently, what comes out of my mind isn't so
worthless as you'd like my family, friends and everyone in the world
to think.

I'd like to see some of you sit there and read my articles aloud on
video. It would probably be amusing, though I'd really prefer to
massage and facilitate your understanding of what I have to say
because it only matters if you actually understand it. Instead you run
away from every debate opportunity like an ostrich with its head cut
off. Not see that, you assholes. How are you going to disconnect me
now?
