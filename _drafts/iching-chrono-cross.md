![Chrono Cross Six Dragons]()

- TODO: mention Chrono Cross's references to "Six Dragons"
  - ever wonder why I'm obsessed about Trigger/Cross? It's because of
    Trigger's similarity to Theosophy, perhaps purely incidental, and
    because of both game's dissection of Fate, AI and the Singularity.
  - the series is like an onion. every few years, I discover a
    completely new layer to the motivations behind the story design
    and characters that draw me back in.

- i've checked: no one on the western internet has picked up this
  connection between Chrono Cross and I Ching. there are almost no
  results for `"Chrono Cross" "I Ching"`, but there *is* clearly a
  connection. whether I interpret that connection properly is another
  question entirely. I'll stick to generalities. Despite how it might
  seem, I don't know the ins and outs of Chrono Cross as well as
  Chrono Trigger.

- how do you get all six dragons in I Ching? there are two ways:
  - (1) The Creative, unchanging: sample Hexagram 1 with no changing
    lines
    - Probability: `(5/16)^6 = (15625/16777216) = (0.000931322574615)`
  - (2) The Receptive Changing into the Creative: sample Hexagram 2
    with all changing lines
    - Probability: `(1/16)ˆ6 = (1/16777216) = (0.000000059604645)`

- The likelihood of drawing the second iching reading above (The
  Receptive changing into the Creative) is *exceedingly* rare. A real
  challenge: `1 in 16,777,216`  readings should ever give
  this reading. You're more likely to bridge into an parallel
  universe, defeat six dragon gods, inverting the Stagnation of Fate
  and bringing Peace to Earth thenceforth.

- since the endgame of the Chrono Cross plot is about conquering those
  dragons across two parallel worlds (no worries, there are no
  spoilers here)
  - Three Dragons in "home world"
    - #1 Green Dragon ()
    - #2 Earth Dragon ()
    - #3 Water Dragon ()
  - Three Dragons in "another world"
    - #4 Fire Dragon ()
    - #5 Black Dragon ()
    - #6 Sky Dragon ()

- {Spoiler: Harle}, a seventh pseudo-dragon-god is available as a
  playable character. [Tsukuyomi (月
  読)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tsukuyomi-no-Mikoto) is the
  character's Japanese name, which is Shinto's God of the Moon.
  - But: we're missing one, aren't we? There are supposed to be
    *eight* trigrams.
  - (Therefore), there is a complement to Tsukuyomi's allusion. It is
    {spoiler: Kid} [Amaterasu (天
    照)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amaterasu).
    - from this interpretation, {Schala's} DNA or form was split into
      two pseudo-clones: {Kid} and {Harle}.

- {spoiler: Once you defeat the dragon gods, everything in the game
  from the very, very beginning is explained. The initial scene of the
  game: a terrifying, but prophetic dream.  The meaning to the player:
  You, as Serge, your fate has always been to be here, then. And now,
  all has been revealed and you can take what is yours: the solution
  to Navier-Stokes ... I'm j/k, you may take the Frozen Flame, which
  represents to me the essence of dynamic change. Knowing this is like
  grasping a flame, frozen in time.
  - Unveiling this layer of the onion re-articulates what, to me, has
    been underscored time and time again: Chrono Cross is a
    masterpiece. As a 13 year-old, the idea of the Frozen Flame to me
    was complete mystery: what did it mean? Why was it so crucial?
    Everytime I've peeled back a layer of this onion, I have relearned
    what it meant -- but in doing so, I have never inviolated a
    interpretation of that symbol that I previously held. I have
    merely come closer to understanding a symbol which I believe means
    to apprehend, perhaps experientially, the ineffable nature of
    dynamical, chaotic systems -- of physical, particle systems and of
    the social organism of life itself.
