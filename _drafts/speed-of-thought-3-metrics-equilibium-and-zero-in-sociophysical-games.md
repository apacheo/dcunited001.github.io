- emphasize that the only way to predict social behavior in todays
  world is by proactively driving patterns of behavior
  - so, everything is hopelessly incomputable and can't be modeled. in
    spite of that, proactive tactics can make social networks more
    predictable.
    - but because of adversarial dynamics driven by game theory,
      influential groups struggle to signal over networks to
      proactively drive behavior and can cause the system to become
      unpredictable in ways that can't be predicted...

- set the frame of the reader by asking them to consider this as the
  read the article, then discuss it in further detail later
- what does it mean to have zero for some of these metrics?
  - no, really: in each metric for each category above, what do the
    concepts of zero, identity, mean (additive and geometric), range,
    independence, connectedness, etc mean

### Social Mechanics

#### Psychosocial [Valence](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Valence_(psychology))

- abuse of the
  [Valence Effect](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Valence_effect) in
  antifragile networks of agency, where information is covertly
  managed with zealously utilitarian tactical efficiency to retain
  advantage in all situations when managing a "cancer on society" --
  i.e. *DAVID CONNER*
- mathematically accounting for the psychosocial dynamic of "opposites
  attract" for basic/sophisticated personality types
  - psychological "valence"
  - if connections and interactions b/w people are facilitated
    alleviating the gradient of disparity of knowledge/information,
    then what does this say generally about people who are basic and
    people who are well-educated
    - what are the psychosocial dynamics that emerge between
      combinated pairings/groupings of people
      - how do these dynamics change when people have various ranges
        of aggregate knowledge levels or various ranges of knowledge
        levels in specific fields
  - this becomes more complicated when considering the same problem
    for various types of knowledge (i.e. level of sophistication in
    various fields)
  - but, generally, people who have a higher disparity in
    knowledge/information from different fields will have more to talk
    about or more value to offer each other in terms of the knowledge
    they have to share.
  - "if you're the smartest person in the room, find another room."
- typologies of variation in psycho/socio/cultural dimensions,
  quantified with social media data.
- exploiting social media filter bubbles to create false consensus
  effect in targets, which can contribute to gaslighting campaigns


# (Physics Analogies for Social Systems)

The speed of information is just one quantifiable social metric whose
momentary (scale) lead profoundly impacts interaction across
society. Just like thermal energy, sociophysical system operate with,
preserve and disperse energy, but this energy can usually be
defined in infinitely many ways.

  - (succinctly describe other metrics at a high level, that were
    easily observable by people throughout history, whose trends could
    be anticipated)
  - distribution of information
  - spectrum of available information
  - spectrum of modes of communication
  - value of information

- people as particles: temperature, density, state, etc.
- speed of sound
- phase changes
- configurational entropy & conformational entropy

### Tempurature

- should this be moved to an article on social physics?
- the ideas of "temperature" and "energy" for the high-dimensional
  systems of social physics
  - spatial or physical temperature/energy/motion
  - the more metaphysical, high-dimensional temperature/energy of
    information

- social physics temperature, induced by sunrise
  - informational movement from east to west
    - increasing "temperature"

### Speed of Information Transfer



### Particles and Molecules

- (note up front that everything in this paragraph is overly
  simplified. rename people as particles and describe it as a
  simulation)
- IRL social interactions are constrained by the spaces they occur in.
  - if viewed top-down in 2D, geometric patterns emerge.
  - this is where the physics interactions get interesting because, if
    you idealize them to a sociophysical model, people interact with
    shared fields, just like particles do.
    - there are fields that attract and repel. there are fields that
      are far more complicated than any in physics, like the shared
      field of attention.
    - when interacting, people try to harmonize the space between each
      other. they like to be close when they are interested in the
      interaction, but not too close.
      - so in an overly simplistic model, they influence a shared
        field that causes them to repel and attract each other.
    - but, people are constantly reading each other and there is this
      shared field of attention that emerges.
      - people have a natural urge to know what other people are
        interested in. so, they subconsciously read signals that
        indicate attention
        - imagine a 2D space with a heat map that shows everyone's
          average object of attention
        - they are naturally pulled towards the areas of the heatmap
          that are strongest.
        - they are pulled towards the gradient of the laplacian of the
          group's influence on the shared field of attention... (reword
          this)
        - IRL, it's not so simple.

- then you can define rules that determine which particles can
  transmit information
  - they have to be within some minimum distince to "connect"
  - once they are connected to a group, the simulation's interactions
    have a set rules
  - but particles should form groups that resemble molecules, but
    because of how the particles simultaneously repel and attract each
    other, they form a fairly limited set of molecule shapes.
    - the shapes are primarily circular (2-6 people can easily circle
      together and talk in a fairly noisy space)
    - but then, depending on how each particle's attention affects
      their behavior and physical orientation, these primary shapes
      can merge to form more complex shapes.
  - these group connections have a logical graph structure that is
    imposed ontop of the physical structure (the shape of the
    "molecule")
    - IRL, people are moreso thinking about the logical structure when
      they interact, but the physical structure also matters.

- the geometry that emerges in IRL social interactions also adheres to the
  spatial constraints.
  - the physical arrangement of objects in the space contributes
    heavily to range of possibilities for interactions that emerge,
    but also strongly shapes the physical and logical geometry of
    group interactions.
    - feng shui helps us think about this aspect of social
      interactions
  - this sounds complicated, but isn't. if there's a restaurant with
    ten tables in one of its rooms, the people who sit down can only
    arrange themselves in specific ways.
    - this is similar to "holes" in N-doped and P-doped silicon
      transisters, if we're overly eager for physics analogies.
  - so, the physical arrangement of the space and functional specifics
    of its objects tends to constrain the configurational and
    conformational entropy of interactions in the space.

### Reynold's Number

- (reynold's number)
        - describes the parameters at which turbulent fluid flow
          emerges. (but what is turbulence for high-dimensional
          sociophysical particle systems)


# Critical Metrics for Sociophysical Systems

- connect these to the 7 hermetic principles

### General/Specific Speed of Information Transfer

- the speed at which any piece of information could travel

### Probabilities & Rates of Datum/Meme Expression

### Rates & Status of Convergence

- the definition of information convergence across a network
  - that is, at what percentage of people in a network would you
    consider the piece of information common knowledge?
  - this is an important metric because its definition affects
    "velocity" of convergence or "distance remaining" to convergence
  - what are the specific ideas from math that define this in abstract
    terms?
    - this would concern metrics of convergence for graphs and is
      probably related to entropy

- the length of time it takes for an urgent piece of information to
  converge across a network.

- (better word than convergence?)
  - consensus?

### Information Permanence

- the degree of repition or replication that's required for
  information to achieve permanence, with various levels of technology.
  - before writing, only highly-prioritized information would be
    achieve convergence through replication.
  - after the printing press, ...


### Informational Entropy

- shannon entropy (i.e. informational entropy) related to the
  more abstract structure of information
  - in other words, what kinds of information, messages and ideas are
    most people going to talk about
  - in a language or character set, this is easier to define.
  - in this context, the structures and variations you are measuring
    are infinite
  - this measure of entropy is important for understanding how to
    distract and disguise.

### Sociophysical and Dirichlet Energy

- measures of energy for information transfer/convergence
  - literal physical energy required to transfer information
  - dirichlet energy (?)
    - this is a generic measure of energy. what are some specific
      examples of applying this idea to sociophysical systems?

### Information Network Flux Dynamics

- the quantity, qualities and dynamics of information flux networks.
  - do nodes exchange information at regular times? with what degree
    of certainty?
  - which nodes exchange information? how often? how much?
    - are any of these things predictable?
      - you'll find that, the more physically bound a social system
        is, the more confidant you can be in predicting/anticipating
        these things.

### Information Network Structure & Superimposition

- measuring/analyzing the graphs/networks in sociophysical systems
  - (are there better terms for these ideas? it'd be better to find
    the right terms from math/physics)
  - interpersonal networks viewed as graphs
    - hierarchical structures: identifying subgraphs ... which are
      self-similar
    - identifying boundaries in the graphs
    - identifying geographic boundaries with a higher capacity to be
      "expander graphs" for the global system (reword this?)
      - this describes america/europe and other areas with diverse
        populations. these areas are more tightly connected with the
        rest of the world.
      - this well-connected aspect of america's social network can be
        leveraged as an asset. (soft power, economic development,
        etc.)
        - expander graph may not be the appropriate term, but
          describes a graph that is maximally connected from any node,
          while having a relatively minimal number of connections.
        - so, from any arbitrary node, you can find a minimal path to
          any other node in the graph. (viz. it's an efficiently
          structured graph. the complete graph is not a good expander
          graph because it's not efficiently connected)
        - AFAIK, the human brain functions as an expander graph with
          some other regular structure

### Permeability and Diffusion

  - analyzing the sociophysical dynamics of information diffusion
    - are some areas more porous?
      - more likely to retransmit information?
      - more likely to absorb new information?
    - how do differences in language affect the transmission of
      information?

### Generic Concepts of Regularity in the System

- measuring the regularity of phenomena in the system

- measuring the different kinds of flux in a system

### Agents, Vessels and Vectors for Information Dispersion

- (REMOVE: already described)
- vessels for containing information
  - (these aren't metrics, but there are important metrics related to
    them)
  - vehicles for moving information
    - foot, horse, car, signal fire
    - imagine your a shady villan from a disney movie and you need to
      stop a message from getting to your king.
      - you know it's a letter; you know the messenger left 5 minutes
        ago; there are X roads leading to X towns
      - you can order people to move as fast as they can to stop the
        messenger, but you need to know whether you can stop the
        message, otherwise you have to change your plans.
      - can you be sure the people you order can outrun a messenger,
        if you don't know who they are?
      - (change the specifics in this scenario?)
      - people have a set of options available to them to transfer
        information. the mechanics of each option is crucially
        important when trying to decide if the information can
        physically escape.

### Using Social Physics to Contain/Promote People and Ideas

- sociophysical "jails" or "manacles"
  - ok, probably don't actualy use the term manacles.
    - but the point of these sociophysical tactics for social
      engineering is to make it "painful" to "move" in a sociophysical
      sense, until you comply.
    - it's like a horrible pyramid scheme crossed with
      [Milgram's Experiment](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Milgram_experiment)
      - it plays out IRL, in any digital realm you enter, on any
        social media site.
      - there is nothing you can do and the NSA apparently facilitates
        all of this horribly dark shit with ZERO oversight from our
        leaders and ZERO accountability
        - there is literally ZERO understanding of the techniques the
          NSA is using, so there can be no accountability because our
          leaders simply do not know what questions to ask
        - nothing brings you more pain than asking these questions

### Psychiatry (probably re/move this section)

- the western conceptualization of the mind is utterly flawed and the
  materialistic understanding is making americans sick on a massive
  scale, where the easy, cheap treatment for insurance to cover is
  medication. (pull this into a separate article?)
  - the problem is, the chemical imbalance theory in somehwere b/w
    20-80% of cases of moderate mental illness causes psychiatrists in
    particular to treat a totally fallacious cause
    - because the actual root cause is not treated (*the information
      attributed to the patient that is distributed among people in
      their social network*), it's like treating cancer with placebo
      sugar. medication in many cases does nothing, if not exacerbates
      mental illness.
      - this statement will be received controversially, but
        information has a life of its own in sociophysical
        networks.
        - it is difficult/impossible to quanity/assess the
          information, but therapy can help encourage dialogue
        - also, it's not healthy for people to assume the problem lies
          elsewhere... individuals have no control over what other
          people are thinking.
        - however, information injected into sociophysical networks
          literally has a life of its own and once its diffused into
          people's minds, it is almost certainly there forever or
          until each social connection decides to overlook it, (which
          often requires communiction and demonstration of changed
          habits, etc => to each individual the information has
          diffused into)
        - by "information has a life of it's own" i mean these are
          !@#$'ing probabilistic programs that self-replicate
          information
          - usually sophys networks/dynamics are intractibly complex
            that information overload causes most of your social
            connections to be so innundated with details relevant to
            their own life, that they don't necessarily frame their
            interactions based on problematic information attributed
            to your identity.
          - the best way to address these situations is through
            communication. however, similar to how tweet storms ravage
            the social media landscape with self-replicating
            information, so do sophys. information programs
          - this goes right back to the article that i wrote about
            chaotic programming, which is a paradigm that describes
            genetics, human cognition and the dynamics of information
            in social networks.
      - if the medical establishment ever gave me the time of day,
        they would ridicule my arguments here. but this conception of
        sociphysical vectors for mental illess is irrefutable
        - *the chemical imbalance theory will be _destroyed_ by
          computational medicene by 2030* and at that time, the tables
          will be turned and the truth will be set free: the chemical
          imbalance theory is only a primary factor in a minority of
          mental illness.
        - once people realize what they've paying out their ass for a
          sham and sedating themselves with (occasionally) useless
          psychatric medication, they will be furious
    - ok, given some assumptions that, by 2030:
      - for approx 20% of patients w/ mild-to-moderate mental illness,
        comp. medicine will *CONCLUSIVELY, IRREFUTABLY* prove that any
        amount of medication was inappropriate for these patients (the
        assumption is that certainly, any meds were wrong, & therefore
        unnecessarily altered epigenetic expression in the brains of
        patients, therefore *giving* them mild chemical imbalances)
      - and assume that, for another 20-60% of other patients w/
        mild-to-moderate mental illness, medicine ....

### Intentional

- propagation of mental illness
  - from parents to child (it's really a situation where there is
    diminished propagation of information to build traits needed for
    early/adolescent developmental ish.)
    - so, not actually propagation of the illness, but if it happens,
      it can result from constrained variety of experience or reduced
      permeability b/w parent/child
      - so, it's transmission of habits, etc.

### Muting A Target's Identity

- ![Neo Matrix]()

- turn down volume of someone by refusing to refer to their
  name/identity. the more their name, their identity or details
  related to life are referenced, the more that those details diffuse
  into the sociophysical environment
  - as in Voldemort, "he who should not be named"
  - this has many effects, including driving someone crazy, who is
    always referred to in the 4th person or as a "ghost"
  - this artificially reduces any sociophysical signal related to
    their identity and prevents others from perpetuating it.
  - once the person is no longer around, very little memory or residue
    remains of their existence.
    - DEATH OF A SALESMAN
  - taken to the extreme, this person is a living ghost and simply
    haunts from one place to another, where people who happen to see
    them have to deal with what is in front of their eyes, but never
    authentically try to interact or develop a relationship
    - if you are this person, you'll notice how fast people try to
      shut down or redirect conversations you want to have. this is
      because they don't want other people to retain positive memory
      of you or anything you are interested in.
    - if you have aspergers or other issues where you lack strong
      social skills, you'd never know what it's like to live a normal
      life. you'd simply never know the difference. this is my life.

- say what you will, but this simply optimizes sociophysical ideas:
  number of references to you, rate/quality of new social connections,
  rate/quality of social interactions, depth of conversation, etc.

### Isolation of Social Graph Boundaries

- The physical or graph boundaries of someone's social network can be
  identified, as well as nodes & regions of it that are more widely
  connected.
  - Boundaries and local connectedness are ideas that are widely
    studied in graph theory.
  - Information is viral and causes people to react differently. Some
    people are loud, others are quiet. Most everyone acts to bring
    about some understanding of what is "good" and by framing
    information in those terms, it can be presented in such a way to
    subtly cue the person to action.
  - Most everyone that acts righteously feels good about what they do.
  - So if you suggest information to highly connected, nodes on the
    boundaries of someone's social network, it leads adjacent nodes to
    move further away from the person and become less connected in
    general.
  - Life is full of flux in the social structure. People move away,
    start families and there are many other events which change the
    social graph. People gravitate towards the areas of their social
    graph where the social connections were reinforced.
    - The person who does not or can not both gradually grow new
      strong connections or reinforce existing social connections will
      end up isolating themselves, if this goes on long enough.
    - by injecting information into someone's graph that increases
      resistence of new connection, disrupts existing connections or
      forces most social interactions to be lensed through a negative
      frame, you can isolate someone. In most circumstances, this does
      not happen because one person simply cannot exert that much
      influence over the boundary of someone's social network.

  - however, if you end up social isolated, it can be very difficult
    to build new connections.
    - this depends on many factors, including how widely information
      has been disseminated that alters the implicit frame someone's
      social interactions.
      - for example, celebrity defamed by scandal can have a VERY
        difficult time building their network back. Since information
        is viral, its effects are multiplicative, including how it
        poisons the frame. people in these social circles gravitate
        towards where they anticipate that influence *will* be, not
        where it is and certainly not where it was.

### Use of Fear/Love to Contract/Expand A Target's Social Boundaries

- projection of fear enables these people to use their energy more
  efficiently.
  - non-physical pain is harder to define, but people move away from
    it just like they do when they experience its physical counterpart.
  - for the people in a 1-degree and 2-degree social neighborhood (IRL
    or virtual) -- i.e. their social boundary -- if you
    project/condition fear of the target, most people will move away
    from him/her, especially if they do not feel strong to face that
    fear themselves.
  - since the fear is non-physical, harder to define and its quality
    is multifarious, people trying to contain a target can invoke in
    the social boundary members at least one compelling reason to stay
    away from the target
  - if you successfully motivate through fear, then the individuals in
    the social boundary will become conditioned and even spread that
    fear amongst themselves.
    - they become vectors for disseminating your will/animus and
      malice towards the target.
    - at this point, not only is it unnecessary to waste your energy
      incurring liability to inflict pain on the target and his/her
      social boundary, you don't have to waste energy to spread this
      information because, as a self-perpetuating sociophyisical
      dynamic, it becomes effectively autonomous.

- however, there are individuals who do not fear. they do not fear
  specific things or, foolishly, they do not fear anything.
  - to me, it is more important that no one ever be successful when
    the tactics above are used unjustly and/or with malice. this is
    something more important to me to act against completely,
    successful and early than my own safety.
  - also, i am the kind of person who becomes curious, when they are
    presented with something they know they should fear. I want to
    know why i fear it and, as a general tactic to undermining it if I
    find it is something I believe is unjust, a sign of malicious
    intent or someone neutral acting under the influence of
    manipulation, then i actually want to get closer to the thing I
    fear.
    - this is also why some investigative techniques can be abused on
      me in order to make the claim that I was trying to get close to
      something illegal/immoral/terrorist/etc.
      - someone with enough legal/investigative/psychological
        experience would certainly know they could abuse my simple,
        foolish reactions to draw me closer to say i wanted to be part
        of something, when truly i never understood anything that was
        going on.
  - not only do i fear nothing, i have nothing left to lose except my
    personal sense of dignity/honor/etc.

### Don't Become Big Enough To Be A Target, Work Indirectly And Disdain Ego

- just to be clear. i hate almost everything i'm writing about here.
  - to understand it, to fight it and to contain it, i have immersed
    myself in understand it and everything that happened to me.
- in the utilitarian, pragmatic manipulation of social networks, it is
  important to establish your network as a kind of power broker for
  financial/social influencer. you don't want to be nominally known as
  such a gatekeeper at all.
  - in fact, you'd very much like for someone close to you or under
    your influence to be known as the person with power. people with
    social/financial power are magnetic: for those that don't have
    power, magnates can make your dreams reality or, at least, that is
    what those without power are drawn to believe.
  - furthermore, if you are knowingly concerting machiavellian
    mechanations to drive or influence events close your networks, do
    you want that attention and allure that comes along with being
    someone known to have power?
    - no, it is very likely that person will become the fallguy
      - or at least, their magnetic pull as being known as powerful
        will absorb some of the karmic consequences of mechinations
        that become known.
  - but if you are practicing these utilitarian, amoral tactics
    pragmatically, you can lens the energy of people in your networks
    by leveraging social/financial opportunities as a power broker
    - beware, much of this could be construed as illegal, immoral, etc
      and can result in legitimate corruption cases
    - these opportunities become a kind of resource for you, but it is
      a limited resource with quantity that is difficult to define
    - so, for these people, it is preferable to to identiy those who
      can be deceived, manipulated, pressured to downgrade their
      (negotiation requirements), or -- best of all -- can be given an
      opportunity that will fail fast, fail pleasantly, or fail in
      some way that will enable you to respond advantegeously
      - in this last case, you have legitimately done something for
        them. however, this is essentially setting someone up for
        failure. it is because this is difficult/expensive for upper
        management to diagnose that this is a cardinal sin of busines
        and management.
      - but, life has various sets of rules which only apply in
        certain contexts. if you are not in corporation, corporate
        policy does not apply to you. society's laws always apply to
        you, but what matters in society is belief, perceived belief
        networks and the ability to multiply your influence through
        those things
        - so, someone who is operating as a kind of shadow broker for
          power/influence will find this as an alluring pathway to
          appear to do a favor for someone while truthfully throwing
          them under the bus

  - my fear is that local extensions of homeland security, domestic
    intelligence networks, and etc are beginning to operate to
    dominate regional influence simply towards the attainment of that
    end in itself, for itself. pragmatically, it is easy for them to
    justify both this and total secrecy in everything they do by
    claiming it is for current or future national security, when
    foremost, it is extortion, coercion, racketeering and exactly the
    same as everything else the mafia does.
    - domestic criminal networks may also be adapting to this era of
      technology, social media, illicit surveillance, etc, finding it
      all very convenient towards control, illusion and elusion.

### Limiting/Providing Financial/Social Capital & Options

- financial capital and social capital are exchangable resources.
  - a clever person can exchange financial capital for social capital
    and vice versa, using social capital to multiply their influence
    or identify new opportunities.

  - if you find yourself isolated, you are vulnerable. Depending on
    personality traits, social (potential) and financial capital. it
    can be far more challenging for you to rebound than it is for a
    small group of sycophantic people to indirectly keep you there,
    without ever appearing to have lifted a finger.

  - when your financial capital is limited, you have few options, you
    are strained and this makes you very predictable. when you're
    social behavior is predictable, this means you invest in social
    expansion in a limited number of ways. this makes you more easily
    blocked, especially in the age of social media, where people who
    want to promote themselves post everything online.
    - this kind of indirect coordination is not natural social
      behavior. it doesn't emerge in social groups who have primarily
      individual concerns or simply care about those close to them.
    - this kind of group behavior can be coordinated, kind of like
      someone decided to make sociopathy a team sport.
    - one way this can happen is if a handful of people inject the
      right information into the few circumstances where you try to
      socially expand to compel judgemental, exclusionary behavior
      from neural people. several people can indirectly work through
      others and manipulate what is otherwise natural behavior.
    - i think this is what they call "scientology". however, it's
      strange that a religion based on freeing you from information
      forms known as thetans would also project those same negative
      information forms into your life, but i suppose they just hoping
      you'll develop stockholm syndrome and will pay them to help
      "clean" it up later.
    - if you think this is wrong, i can explain their training
      materials, pattern languages and obsession over "disconnection"
      *THIS IS DISCONNECTION*, by the way.

### When targets are muted and/or isolated, adversaries have major advantages in amplifying information (to establish it as a baseline)

- if you are isolated for months, ...
  - if you are muted and other people can't talk about you or your
    life events, it means that adversaries can project & amplify their
    own signal in neighborhoods of your social network
  - their narrative becomes dominant and you will always be reacting
    to it (...)
    - the signal of your personal account will always be (nearly
      insignificant) if some group of people can actually pull this
      off
    - if a group of people did this to you, you can be sure that they
      will listen for & react to your diminished signal, while
      continuing to amplify their own and walling you into a very
      small set of social connections
      - you won't be able to expand (...)


# (Implications of (your perspective on) Social Physics, Networks and Information Dynamics)

- possibly remove
- why attempting to quantify information structure/dynamics/diffusion,
  along with sociophysical models and game theory leads to deep
  philosophical conclusions about the significance/nature of
  information.
  - if you don't understand what i'm writing about, then it's easy to
    assume that a worldview based on a subjective-but-passionate
    understanding of some ideology (i.e. humanism or marxism) is
    sufficient for dictating or restraining policy.
  - if you don't understand this content (and it isn't easy) then you
    don't actually understand enough about life, society and, in
    particular, human behavior to predict how policy will affect
    people.
    - if your a passionate humanist and your goal is to help people,
      wouldn't it be useful to understand people, group dynamics, game
      theory to inform your political views?
    - if it's important to you to actually achieve the lofty goals and
      ideals that drive your passion, then you absolutely have to
      understand this subject, otherwise you are forever at a
      disadvantage, unware that you are a piece in someone else's
      game, a leaf blowing about in a windstorm.
- you might be a well-reasoned person living in a land of milk and
  honey who wishes for only the alleviation of human suffering, but
  the world is not full of sunshine and rainbows. life is a game and
  there are many players.
  - if your values and ideals are worth hard work and sacrifice to
    attain, then you have to understand how the other players in this
    game will react to you.
