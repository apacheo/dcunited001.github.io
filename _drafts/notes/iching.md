- include differences b/w this and [XGBoost] and other boosted
    tree-like algorithms
  - this is not an adversarial network, but instead requires many
    pairs of game-playing algorithms to compete against each other,
    with an algorithm on top controlling hyperparameters of handicaps
    and also trying to use the inverse of random forests to infer the
    valuation of trees which match the impairment of game mechanics in
    players ... i.e. how do the games mechanics functionally
    correspond to the features used by the lower-level algorithms and
    can more advanced representations be developed

- discuss Carl Jung's assertion comparing the distinctions between the
  Western and Eastern perspectives on causality to:

  - (TODO: emphasize that chess is not the proper game to use, since
    it's deterministic, though the specifications for move history
    (does not have perfect information))
  - Two chess masters, with varying awareness of game history, who are
    playing some random game selected from an index of all chess
    games, famous or amateur.
    - The two masters awaken towards some random move in the midgame
      of this chess match. One has memory of the total move history
      and thus, the entire causal chain from beginning to end.
      Initially, the other player only knows the arrangement of pieces
      on the board as they are, but from then onwards accumulates
      memory of move history.
    - The residue of experience left in long-term memory may cloud our
      perspective as much as it sharpens our understanding of the
      present. The same is true for working memory used in chess?
  - Which player is likely to win any given game?
  - Given the players, the games and the board-states were properly
    sampled from the universal codex of chess matches, is the second
    player truly at a disadvantage by lacking access to move history?

  - Which player is likely to improve faster: the player who wins or
    the player handicapped by artificial restrictions?
    - What differences, structural or representational, would emerge
      between two initially identical adversarial AI's that were
      trained on chess games? For more complicated games, including
      adversarial AI playing virtualized Soccer or Starcraft, what
      advantages are conferred by knowledge of game history that would
      alter the gradual adaptation of AI's playing those games?
    - This pattern of game construction where players have arbitrary
      restrictions precluding perfect information, limiting game state
      and game history especially, should compel AI's in adversarials
      scenarios to reinforce alternate pathways for problem
      solving. In this way, such handicapping introduces biases
      skewing how a machine-learning algorithm conducts its
      decision-making.
      - While this skew is *qualitative* as it relates to the
        hyperparameter's specified deformation of the game's
        construction, the skew's quantitative impact manifests what is
        essentially an implicit [Tree
        Method](https://medium.com/syncedreview/tree-boosting-with-xgboost-why-does-xgboost-win-every-machine-learning-competition-ca8034c0b283)
      - Why a tree method? Because for the handicapped algorithm to
        pare evenly against the algorithm with perfect information,
        the former must do so by skewing it's prioritization of
        features.

      - Now imagine a hyper-algorithm that is given the theta-weights
        for many of the aboved trained adversarial pairs: these pairs
        can either have identitical hyperparameters specifying altered
        game construction or such can be variable; initially, results
        may tend to be more consistent with identical hyperparameters.
      - What does this hyper-algorithm do?
        - it coalesces across the many trained adversarial pairs and
          attempts to understand the functional relationship between
          aspects of the game construction and the resulting implicit
          skew on theta-weights.
          - it would do this by using a Tree Method to attempt to
            match the combination/weighting of features that matches
            the dissonance in feature-prioritization found in the
            theta-weights of the impaired algorithm. (since, in order
            to compensate for lack of perfect information, the
            impaired algorithm should leverage its features in
            distinct ways to compensate for the difference, thus this
            dissonance in theta weights could be matched by a Tree
            Method, since it's a *generalized*, **analytic** method)
        - why is this challenging? because if the handicap is too
          severe, impaired adversary is always punished by its
          backpropagation function.
