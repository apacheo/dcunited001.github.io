The residue of experience left in long-term memory often jades our
perspective as much as it sharpens our understanding of the
present. You can always choose to not know, but you can never truly
forget. Our consciousness becomes aware of this effects that this
residue in long-term memories when the clarity of our experience of
consciousness is marred upon accessing them. These are emotional
associations to the long-term memories themselves, but also
associations gradually built up by memory of the mind's experiences
reflecting upon memories. i.e. As we reflect on the narratives of life
events, we tend to multiply the effect of emotional associations left
in them, altering the emotional impact felt upon subsequent
access. Left to a poverty of non-traumatic or non-distinct memories,
then our mind accelerates with the only narratives it can reflect
upon: the traumatic or the mundane. Such poverty of variety of
experience leaves nothing but the traumatic to stand out from the
mundane; these becomes the dominant substance to which our mind
anchors itself. Is it any surprise the traumatized mind spirals into
its own abyss?






- there is also something about how the I Ching and any
  (sophisticated... satisfying what properties?) divination method
  intervenes with assumed fate, given (fairly accurate) extrapolation
  of causality.
