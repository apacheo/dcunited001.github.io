#### Notes on Clausewitz

- clausewitz's perspectives in his treatise On War seem to constantly
  invoke ideas from Social Physics, the development of which was still
  in its infancy, as "Le Mechanique Sociale" would not be published
  until the end of the century and the study of sociology had not yet
  begun.
  - still, all the developments of chemistry and phsyics from the late
    18th and early 19th centuries can be seen, as Clausewitz's
    attempts to sum up the theory of warfare constantly employ by
    metaphor the ideas of "equilibrium", the differential connections
    between momentum and force, and the need/utility of
    quantificaiton/metric to measure and ascertain what had likely
    been thought immeasurable.
  - this book is an attempt to develop tools by which strategy and
    tactics can be informed by quantities and laws, so that warfare
    and all its calculations might benefit from the same rationale,
    methods and developments that had recently brought so much
    progress to chemistry and physics.
- the major qualitative differences between warfare and physics result
  from the myriad of forces in sociophysical contexts, when compared
  to the mere four forces of physics.


# Book One

## Chapter One

### 7. War is never an isolated act

- This section and the next are about the causal implications of
  action and the causal inferences motivating the application of
  force.



### 8. It does not consist of a single instantaneous blow

- clausewitz sums up the importance of space on the application of
  force. the dynamics of force, here, are far more multilinear than in
  physics: they certainly involve measurable quantities whose
  trajectories can be ascertained, but due to the myriad sociophysical
  forces motivating the actions of people and to the complex mechanics
  of action, can produce surprising dynamics.
  - however, if one wants to model warfare and social conflict, the
    mechanical complexities of the domain necessary to handle. it is
    not so easily simplified, if accuracy and utility of insight are
    to be maintained.

#### The concepts of Escalation and De-escalation

- in this section, clausewitz discusses the notions of escalation and
  de-escalation, as they relate to the tendancy of action and reaction
  of actors in warfare to snowball and build momentum.
  - he emphasizes the need to quantify resources, to model the
    mechanics of the space ... to know the realm within which one
    operates, so that the nature of the system's evolution may become
    knowable instead of hopelessly intractible.

- the simplification that clausewitz provides by illustrating the
  maximum of applying all possible force at once is necessary to
  illustrate the idea of staging the application of force.
  - in war, and indeed in general social conflict, one orders the
    application of options by the degree of effect they will have on
    one's own circumstances and that of the enemy.
  - in war, the goal is never to escalate, but to identify how one may
    de-escalate without abandoning one's own objectives. how does one
    side compel the adversary to accept its objectives -- without
    needing to resort to escalation? and without unintentionally
    triggering escalation?
    - it is to the attainment of this end that all forethought *before
      conflict* to develop strategic options to be exercised *in case
      of conflict* is spent.
  - one may sort and order these strategic options in a variety of
    ways, but some of the most important are towards the consideration
    of how the execution of such options will escalate tension, at
    home or for your adversary.
    - but further, one may consider how your adversary considers the
      predictability of your execution of strategic options in terms
      of how it believes you conceptualize it would react to them.
      - that is, for two rational adversaries, one would consider
        reasonable the actions of the other which do not too greatly
        perturb the security of both. in other words, each rational
        adversary will first pursue those actions which tolerably
        perturb the situation and stray from those actions which
        introduce too much turbulence.
      - that is ... assuming that the adversaries are motivated by
        rational action and have realistic conceptions of one another.

#### Socio/Informational Spaces

- in the 21st century, we are waging conflict over purely
  informational territories, some of which we are free to create (as
  in the web or on social media, with its pages and groups) but just
  the same as with physical space, the collective force applied by
  individual actions is dispersed as the surface area of the space
  increases or decreases.
  - by controlling the space (via development or funneling of content
    creation) one may exert control over the collective focus or
    diversion of social media users operating in that space.
  - clausewitz's writing is timeless; one merely requires imagination
    to reapply his ideas for the 21st century. if you look around with
    a military mindset, you will find that so many groups are doing
    just that: the activity of people is being manipulated with the
    intent to divert or focus their force. however, the nature of the
    *space* is phenomenologically distinct ... and for a time, the
    mechanics and dynamics of people's interaction within these spaces
    will remain relatively unknown.
  - in the unconscious there is power: the power to manipulate people
    with forces and mechanics of which they are unaware. so long as
    our life in such a brave new world retains its novelty, people are
    being manipulated in ways they can not understand. the powers that
    be which are moving to manipulate people in such a way enjoy their
    ability to do so and understand that as soon as people wake up to
    the realities of the primarily informational spaces in which they
    now life, these powers will be less capable of such manipulation.
