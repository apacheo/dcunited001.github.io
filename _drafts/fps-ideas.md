# FPS Games

- many of these are generic and would work with any FPS. most of these
  I've been imagining while playing overwatch

### Metrics for Overwatch

- total damage given/received, heals given/received
- efficient utilization of controls
  - advanced players always have a better grasp of the
    controls.
    - e.g. on PS4 Overwatch, i can use four fingers on left & right to
      control all features of mercy with zero inhibition or increase in
      perceived complexity
      - on PC, this is nothing, since you have a Keyboard and full
        range of complexity
- efficient utilization of cooldown
  - advanced players will always exhibited a distribution of ability
    inter-activation times *that includes* a lower bound short times

- metrics parameterized by simplicial complex
- 1D time series for



### Signals Analysis to Identify Aim Hacks

- this already exists AFAIK. it's easy to beat. aim hacks will always
  modify control motions in ways that are appear to be a confusing,
  merged stream of combined mouse input sources where the (dx/dy) of
  each source is characteristically different with each update cycle
  - that is, the player's mouse will always move fairly smoothly
    whereas the aim hacks input modification will not necessarily be
    smooth
  - the combination of both mouse & aim hack will certainly NOT be
    smooth and there will be two distinct jittery streams of combined
    input, where the continuity characteristics of the single
    combined, observed stream are minimal.
    - since the stream is always cycling discrete updates, any notion
      of "continuity" between differentiation/integration is arbitrary
      - therefore, the methods of continuity analysis must account for
        this, but it's very difficult to combine two streams without
        producing artifacts, though they may be difficult to detect
        with a discretized input signal
        - is this true for merged user input streams or for
          artificially modified streams generally?
    - if there is the presence of discontinuous noise in the mouse
      movement (i.e. lots of jitter from one of the dual input sources
      to cancel out the difference between the player's mouse and the
      aim hack's input)
  - another way to defeat aim hacks is to encourage the inclusion of
    accelerometers in the player's mouses. this augments the analysis
    of continuity and consistency

- and map hacks?
  - ... hmmm.. it's hard to detect a high rate of "lucky" guesses
    because the window of time is so large

- reverse map "hack"
  - what was this idea? it wasn't a hack to cheat ... but may appear
    to be, from the perspective of Overwatch if it required signalling
    many requests for game-state data to the server
    - i think generally, online FPS games prefer to use server
      architectures which are Pub/Sub where the battle.net server
      publishes game-state changes to players
      - ideally, the players can only send UI data
      - however, in practice, with (> 20ms) or especially (> 50ms)
        ping times, there are significant requirements for consensus



### Signals Analysis to Quantify Player Engagement





### Signals Analysis To Detect Players Who Are Unreasonably Boosting Novices

- high variance in DPS and other "engagement" metrics
  - hopefully simple metrics
- need to pair fps in-game player/team signals/metrics with metadata
  - e.g. identify multiple accounts with same IP address and/or
    PC/Console ID multiple accounts
    - can't play more than one game at a time

### Signals Analysis To Detect Throwing Player Signatures

- detect players who are throwing the game (and other lame passive
  aggressive behaviors)
  - it's easy to detect idle players



# Metagame and Balancing

### Metrics/Measures for Map Balancing

#### Static

- autogenerated manifolds representing the navigable space for each
  character model
  - different characters can naturally navigate different 3D regions
    of the 3D space of the map
    - this may be different when including physics
    - for some overwatch characters

#### Accumulated (via playtesting)



### Methods for Staging Metagame Updates

- planning how to keep the game interesting as minor/major patches
  come out, as well as major expansions
  -

- this is stuff i've thought about for a long time
  - (i've always wondered how blizzard did it...)
  - then, i realized => blizzard must have realized that you're not
    chasing "perfect" but instead you're chasing the "perfect"
    imperfect
    - and using playtesting & game-designer intuition to anticipate
      your players' response in how they adapt their strategy/tactics
      - many players won't notice. some will notice immediately. there
        will be a lot of flux in gameplay style gradually, but at
        differing rates at various strata of skill levels
  - you have to be familiar with how your players will respond,
    tactically and emotionally.
    - you need to be able to identify/discuss the "unnamable" aspects
      of gameplay and strategy. if you can measure these aspects
      that's fantastic.
    - you need to state/quantify your expectations for how change
      metagame will occur, then observe the changes and reflect on
      expected/actual response

  - you need the ideal amount of change: not so much your players get
    jerked around & frustrated, but enough that there's always a
    challenge to adapt.
    - with enough regular players, it may be possible to use big data
      to measure this amount of change and maybe speculate on the
      ideal amount of change

- however, if your process is too automated, then you can't have
  mnemonic values for gameplay mechanics (character HP, ability
  recharge time/cost/ammo)
  - these values need to be easy to remember. time is always easy to
    change (refresh time) because in a player's head, it's a feeling,
    not a number. they may know the ability refresh time, but they
    aren't *counting* it, like they count shots with Zarya when
    lobbing grenades.
  - in other words, "mnemonic" values are easy to remember, they don't
    get changed to 87 then 35 then 50, etc. so, the players can expect
    to *count*. if they can't expect this, then many players won't use
    repeatable tactics based on values and value ratios.
  - it's a wierd phenomenon, like deciding on whether to charge $1.75
    for a coffee before or after taxes, but much more critical to your
    player's cognition during gameplay and the level of effort they
    need to invest to stay up to date.
    - because of the above, you have to

- methodic/pragmatic staging of metagame via game theory
  - video games are ALL about game theory. every last one of them.

- how to deal with
