<p>At the end of her <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TTrc7zmBh1M&amp;t=0s&amp;index=5&amp;list=PLC4D19CAA84861524">third
video</a>
on I Ching, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLC4D19CAA84861524">Nana Akosua Baakan
Agyeiwaah</a>,
makes a very simple statement that resonates powerfully, <em>if you
understand what the soul is</em>. It doesn’t necessarily require the
definition of the soul outlined below, but if you understand what the
soul is, this statement is very powerful:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The oracle is a vehicle to help us listen to our soul speak, but we
must be <em>quiet</em> if we are to hear what our soul is trying to speak
to us.</p>
</blockquote>

<p><a name="the-soul-is-not-contained-entirely-within-your-body"></a></p>

<h3 id="the-soul-is-not-contained-entirely-within-your-bodythe-soul-is-not-contained-entirely-within-your-body"><a href="#the-soul-is-not-contained-entirely-within-your-body">The Soul Is Not Contained Entirely Within Your Body</a></h3>

<p>The first statement: if the soul exists purely within us, why would we
need to listen to it speak? We should already know what the soul is.
There are aspects of our soul which exist outside of us, whether this
is information that exists substantiated in material form or
connections to elements within the <em>astral plane</em> or shards of our
soul that exist in some purely incorporeal plane.</p>

<p>From my own shortcomings in communication, what I’ve learned is to
listen to others. By listening to Nana Akosua, I’ve learned a lot and
I can tell that she has the same <em>a postieri</em> familiarity with
philosophical and spiritual concepts that I do; it is simply developed
with more wisdom, practice <em>and contact with people.</em> I’ve learned a
lot from watching her videos. However, my own weaknesses there have
taught me to examine the experience and word of others for substance,
<em>not appearance of substance</em>. True substance lies within. If I can’t
listen to others, how the hell could I expect them to listen to me?</p>

<p><a name="if-the-soul-is-not-purely-internal-then-how-does-one-know-their-own-soul"></a></p>

<h3 id="then-how-does-one-know-their-own-soulthen-how-does-one-know-their-own-soul"><a href="#then-how-does-one-know-their-own-soul">Then How Does One Know Their Own Soul?</a></h3>

<p>The second statement: we must be still to separate ourselves from the
noise of life that interferes with the vibrations from our soul. We
need to develop that sense of a soul connection, so that our actions
<em>resonate</em> with our deeper, more authentic self – it is found
<em>somewhere</em> in our soul, but that might not exist within us already.</p>

<p><a name="one-does-not-simply-accept-their-identity"></a></p>

<h3 id="one-does-not-simply-accept-their-identityone-does-not-simply-accept-their-identity"><a href="#one-does-not-simply-accept-their-identity">One Does Not Simply Accept Their Identity</a></h3>

<p>So many people accept at face value either some identity given to them
by others or perhaps the assumed identity developed by a younger
self. They stop looking or maybe they’ve never looked much at
all. This is what’s so dangerous about the materialist misconception
that <em>there is no soul!</em> What do you mean by that? Do you even know?
To the person who needs soul-searching, if they believe the soul
resides entirely within some interalized encoding of matter interally,
then they allow the noise of life to define all they see and all they
think. They believe the extent of their soul to exist entirely
separately of society and this is a dangerous assumption because it
deprives the person of power over their mind, over their life and over
the composition of their soul.</p>

<p><a name="didnt-i-say-that-her-statement-had-a-powerful-effect-on-me"></a></p>

<h3 id="didnt-i-say-that-her-statement-had-a-powerful-effectdidnt-i-say-that-her-statement-had-a-powerful-effect"><a href="#didnt-i-say-that-her-statement-had-a-powerful-effect">Didn’t I Say That Her Statement Had A Powerful Effect?</a></h3>

<p>If you can manage to separate yourself from the mental mazes that
life’s trappings has you running in your mind, then you can start to
zero out life’s noise to calibrate a clearer picture of your true self
– who is not <em>one</em>, but <em>many</em>. Your soul contains within it all your
potential selves: some unrealized; others that have remained out of
focus; more still are as yet unknown to you, without further knowledge
of self! This knowledge of self provides a collection of lenses and
perspectives that form a kind of a microscope for your mind, your soul
and your self. What seems blurry today should seem more clear
tomorrow. And iff you tune this scope of self knowledge, then you’ll
see your composite actualized selves coalescing from your self
awareness breaking through threshold shadows of unconscious.</p>

<p><a name="are-the-myriad-fragments-of-your-soul-searching-for-knowledge-of-self"></a></p>

<h3 id="are-the-myriad-fragments-of-your-soul-searching-for-knowledge-of-selfare-the-myriad-fragments-of-your-soul-searching-for-knowledge-of-self"><a href="#are-the-myriad-fragments-of-your-soul-searching-for-knowledge-of-self">Are The Myriad Fragments of Your Soul Searching For Knowledge of Self?</a></h3>

<p>The true key is to listen to people: they contain within them
fragments of your soul that you must collect. If you do not listen,
you cannot see clearly. If someone has made it so that you cannot hear
them at all, then you may be lost for some time.  If you’re lucky, you
find that most of your newfound selves are also searching for their
knowledge of self: the fragments of your soul or socially distributed
self are themselves searching for self. When you develop a clearer
resolution of self, you begin collecting information from these
socially distributed fragments that key you in to your whole soul,
entirely. This is your true self, but if you are not <em>still</em>, you
cannot <em>listen</em>. Once you learn to listen, you can begin to learn to

<p>Perhaps driven by some miraculous accident in youth, when your psyche
still nascent forming shone a light unto the right unconscious corners
, then perhaps this configured the interface between one’s psyche and
the unconscious in some miraculous way. To what end? To Seek
continuous self improvement without the defect of a false sense of
completion after one learns so much of the world. How does one stay on
the path?  How does one stay course on the Hero’s journey? Does the
hero with the longest journey result with unsurpassed heroic
development?</p>

<p>Some miracle compels the early and prevalent formation of a metatype
in your psyche’s reward systems that pushes you towards self-awareness
and self-improvement for some higher goal, wherefore the true extent
of which you must remain somewhat unconscious. If you can define the
extent your goals in totality, then they are not great enough to
compel you onwards along the Hero’s journey. It must be something
seemingly insurmountable that you will master because you must
overcome it, not because you understand it or are capable of
deconstructing it. This is the true path to awakening and
self-actualization: it is indeed <em>not</em> medication, IMO, though that
may help some to numb their pain. Yet, isn’t there a purpose to pain?
It’s a signal like no other, and it’s there for a reason.</p>

<p>If you were unconscious to what drove you to seek self-improvement by
expanding knowledge of self, then it might more strongly express
itself almost as if by instinct. One does not simply “turn off” that
of which one is unaware. Therefore, mid-development, as you begin to
awaken to the sophisticated metacognition and the self-reflection
required for self-actualization, then that instinctual compulsion has
perhaps given you quite a head start.</p>

<p>The socially distributed variation in the diversity of human
experience and <em>psychic</em> configuration – the configuration of one’s
psyche – is in itself miraculous. Every flower is beautiful in its
own way. It is up to you to find that jewels hidden in your
psyche. Somewhere buried within your mind, your memories and even the
trauma, there is to be found a miracle that gives you purpose. There
must be and if you find it not, then you make it.</p>

<p>The corollary: It is horrible when people refuse to enable any
progression from your current state. They look upon your manufactured,
fabricated identity – over which you had little control – and
short-circuit all progress. ALL WITHOUT COMMUNICATING WITH YOU ABOUT
IT. They never intended you to succeed and they never cared.</p>

<p>To catalyze self-actualization requires disaggregating the influences
on your mind that spawned so many selves that were…  so the most
significant versions of them can be known and reverse-engineered.
After the disagregation of socially distributed self is
reverse-engineered, then those modified selves must be reoriented
towards an end-goal and wherefore reaggregated. In necessarily terse
terms, this sums of the process of individuation from society – by
deconstructing and reconstructing the socially distributed self.</p>

<p>Once you have disaggregated your socially distributed self, you must
reorient your self … from there, it’s warp-speed all the way. That
is, until you must reassess your location in quadrant four.</p>

<p>Understanding how people understand your identity is critical. We all

with that of the identity of others. People play <a href="https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/epistemic-game/">epistemic
games</a> and
doxastic games<sup id="fnref:doxastic-games"><a href="#fn:doxastic-games" class="footnote">1</a></sup>. These are games centered around
projection and propagation of knowledge or belief. There are many

<p>Your conceived image of self has refracted into myriad images in
society. The collective set of memories that members of society have
formed about you compose your social memory. The individual
recollections of experience can be activated almost like files are
opened on a computer. Individuals in society collectively guide their
attention towards memories that are each associated with collections
of identities.</p>

<p>People can torment you, perhaps eternally, by targeting those
fragments of your soul scattered through society. If they are better
at playing doxastic games, they can strongly influence the social
residue of your soul to distort the collective social memories that
relate to your identity. In extreme cases, they can torment your
aeternal soul perhaps for all time. It requires power. Power over such
horrible, <em>paltry</em> people requires power itself. When you find you
have none, power is best obtained through knowledge. Knowledge is
power.</p>

<p>If you bind people down with fabricated information or belief, that is
wrong. It is especially easy to do to the ignorant, the young … or
people with Asperger’s. Society turned me into a doll into which they

<p>By encouraging sin in youth, people are intrinsically disempowered,
often for the rest of their lives. This was the reason Jesus flipped
the tables of moneychangers, <em>who profited by encouraging sin</em>. In the
<em>ancient era</em>, this was the single thing that angered Jesus: more sin,
more money. Today: more sin, more doxastic leverage: more power over
people. By depriving people of knowledge or of access to a <em>modern
belief system</em>, then people are deprived of the ability to circumvent
doxastic leverage. When such belief system(<strong>s</strong>) begin to emerge,
watch in amazement as authorities censor the hell out of what deprives
them of the ability to enslave youth via sin.</p>

<p>The truth about belief in doxastic games? It does not hold a candle to
truth. Light <em>is</em> truth and <em>light reveals all</em>. Light does not need
strategy or tactics. Light walks in the truth; the truth walks in the
light. Whether one who exemplifies truth walks in the shadow of the
valley of death, threats do not matter: <em>TRUTH</em> is your eternal
guardian. Threats will be rendered moot; swords raised against you
will hesitate and become uncertain. Your enemies will question
themselves. All you have to do is be capable of walking in the light
and magickally, your threats will be rendered moot. When you leverage
the truth as your shield, you truly leverage your own innocence. If
there is a single crack, your enemies will relish in your
destruction. You walk a fine line, but if you manage it, your threats
will cancel out if they manifest at all. To do so is often to give up
greatness and only the truly great can wield power with truth in the
light. To do so requires faith in the truth as a shield, faith in the
process and understanding that is difficult to come by <em>without
religion</em>. If you cannot connect the dots between Psalm 23 and the
power of truth as a guardian, then you need to go to school. To
devalue religion as ancient pre-modern, non-scientific hocus pocus is
the pinnacle of ignorance.</p>

reach for the truth as their weapon or their shield, but they do not
have it. It was pre-meditated fabrication: the “truth” manufactured
and little more – to a limited audience, which is why startups are
perfect. Where there was one fabrication operation, there are
many. There’s no handbook for fabrication: it’s a difficult skill to
teach because it loses its effectiveness when then general public is
aware of the possibility of intentionally manufactured circumstances.</p>

<p>The story of Jesus was perhaps the biggest coverup in history. Whose
coverup? After two millenia, no one will ever know the answer to
that. Proof of the historical Jesus is to be found by abduction:
reading the why’s between the lines.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>“You’re going to need a lot of faith, my dude” - Jesus</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Jesus really drove home that <em>faith without proof</em> thing. If there
<em>was</em> a historical Jesus, it’s as though that shrewd player expected
every move the Romans and Jews would make.  He knew they’d cover up
all those pesky <em>revolutionary</em> questions he asked, like “wherefore
<em>art</em> thou , meek?” – to paraphrase with Shakespearean eloquence, in
case you read Romeo and Juliet, but never understood that line.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>“And the <em>blind</em> and the <em>lame</em> came to Him in the temple; and He
healed them.” – Matthew 21:14</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Where does it say that Jesus toyed with the lives of the weak or
protected them from the truth? He opened their eyes and healed the
sick. He empowered the people for being what they were: people. Ever
individual has inherent power they produce. In the I Ching, this
energy is fire and is discussed in Hexagram 37: Family. This is an
individuals inherent ability to produce and accumulate power, no
matter whether rich or poor. To do so requires <em>knowledge</em>. Knowledge
is power. Jesus opened the eyes of the poor and healed the lame. He
empowered the meek. For this and other ‘blasphemies’ he was crucified
by the Jews and Romans.</p>

<p>The Romans and Jews <em>thought</em> they had killed the enlightened Jesus:
the Jesus whose soul lived on in others. These are doxastic games: to
purge an enlightened individual’s image from society, you must hunt
down all images in the collective social memory that reference their
identity and reshape them. You can brainwash people or use other
tricks to distract their minds from the truth. If there are documents,
you must destroy them. This is why the Dead Sea Scrolls were such a
magnificent cache: they escaped <em>all</em> of the pre-Dark Age document
purges. The burning of the Library of Alexandria and murdering of
scholars in pre-Han China?  They were engineered tragedies of doxastic
games for power by controlling the seeds of all later scholastic
thought.</p>

mankind’s mistakes in committing sins without yet being conscious to
the typologies of consequences of sins. Yet, there is no hiding from
God, for which the question remains: what is God?</p>

<p>The thing about sin is that you must hide it or hide from it the rest
of your life. That’s what the story of Jesus was about, in case you
missed it – freeing man from sin. And if you don’t believe in sinful
nature or profiting from the sinful nature of others, then you don’t
propagate the methods of doing so, unless it is to empower others for
their defense.</p>

<p>Extrapolating from the baseline for what I’m about to describe, then
one may conceive of reincarnation via metaphor. If one’s psyche is a
compositite of metatypes and archetypes, some more aeternal than
others, then we are all similar to those who’ve existed before. How
can you tell? Put two people whose composition of types are similar
into similar situations, and if their thought processes are similar,
the outcomes, their responses or their choices should be similar. Is
that really so hard? Again, this extrapolates from the “baseline”
which this article will establish. I am going to compel materialists
to accept at least this much.</p>

<p>If one defines the psyche has the mind within the constraints of our
body, then in the typological terms of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Type_theory">Type
Theory</a> if our
singleton-type representing our individual psyche is composed of
metatypes and archetypes, it becomes straightforward to compare each
others psyche by contrasting type-composition. Furthermore, if we
assume these metatypes and archetypes are drawn from an interwoven
ontology of psychosocial typologiess – which I hope to eventual map
onto a structure similar to E8 to marry the physical and metaphysical
– then this only strengthens the application of my baseline of the
soul. Given this conception, if we are all so similar to people who’ve
existed before, we might as well say we are “the reincarnation of X, Y
or Z” …</p>

<p>What is a perturbation? Well, whether you can explain the answer to
that depends on what kind of rationalist or atheist you are…</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Did you graduate high school? College? Yes? Do you still feel
conflicted while you’re reading my article? Then, you’re the dumb
kind of atheist. Guess what, disrespectful humiliation of someone’s
ideas is a two-way street! Want to humiliate and disrespect me? I
can smack-fu with you all over the this two-way street. <em>Give
respect where respect is due and this two-way street will start
paying dividends, dumbass.</em></p>
</blockquote>

<p>Perturbations allow you to inject noise or random behavior into neural
networks and see what comes out. You’re basically comparing a system
– whose pure states are unknown or perhaps unknowable in totality –
with a more idealized system whose states are more clear. This is
accomplished by injecting noise into the former system to see how the
induced changes move its states towards or away from the the latter,
more ideal system. At each step in machine learning, gradient descent
is typically paired with a kind of simplified perturbation without
some known ideal system to compare it to. This simplified kind of
perturbation has noise whose magnitude is controlled via the
algorithms hyperparameters, which control the learning rate.</p>

<h3 id="of-alice-and-bob-networks-and-hyperplanesof-alice-and-bob-networks-and-hyperplanes"><a href="#of-alice-and-bob-networks-and-hyperplanes">Of Alice and Bob, Networks and Hyperplanes</a></h3>

<p>Let’s say Alice and Bob are both working on a college project to
produce the best image-classification network – for a exam credit in
a course on machine learning. What is exam credit? Fuck if I
know. Anyways, they are both fairly rational and that’s also entirely
beside the point. Perhaps the previous three sentences were
irrational. Do I care? Fuck no. Anyways, Alice get’s real smart and
hacks Bob’s computer. Bob is smart and reads Kaggle posts. He finds a
typical Deep neural net strategy. Every time he trains the network,
Alice has embedded malware that sends his training weights to her
computer. She’s running the same network: that’s what almost everyone
on Kaggle does; they run the best network.</p>

<p>Alice is real smart though, so she decides to construct a General
Adversarial Network on top of the training weights that Bob’s network
produces. Her goal is actually to fuck Bob’s grade in the course
because she’s a true adversary. So, her adversarial network does
typical
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Generative_adversarial_network">GAN</a>
things: it has one half to “generate candidates” that the other half
must classify as being real training data or fake training data. Her
GAN departs from the traditional network: her goal is to train an
algorithm capable of interpolation and extrapolation along Bob’s
hyperplane. In this way, she can hack Bob’s weights at the last minute
(before he submits) and nudge them slightly so that he fails and she
gets the top spot in the class. Yeh, Alice wants to fuck Bob.</p>

<p>What’s any of this have to do with perturbation? Well, in order to
understand how her GAN can manipulate Bob’s network’s theta-weights,
it needs to be able to construct the hyperplane from Bob’s trainings
– assuming he runs the network hundreds of times and she collects the
data. From perturbatation of Bob’s stolen theta-weights, Alice’s
“Hyperplane-Adversarial-Network” can perturbate those theta-weight
values and attempt to guess the how the total score for the network
will change.</p>

<p>In a context with adversarial signals analysis, a critical paradox
arises: optimally rational inferences about another entity’s behavior
requires irrational behavior to <em>scan</em> your adversaries decision
structures. Without the proper amount of irrational behavior, you
cannot consistently win these games or retain advantage in any
rational sense.</p>

<p>This is adversarial signals analysis for neural networks. For Alice to
win and to fuck Bob by adversarially manipulating his network requires
irrational, non-deterministic behavior to make assessments of Bob’s
network. You must perturbate with injected noise to see how the
adversaries conceptions of hyperplane surfaces will respond. This is
true for artificial neural networks, but also game-theoretical
inferences about inter-agent dynamics generally.</p>

<p>In doxastic games, to gain the upper hand, you have to be able to
influence the beliefs and decisions of others. Regardless of the
“scoring” mechanics of any games, if there is any formalized
conception between agents, there are three highly effective methods of
influencing the beliefs and decisions of others. These are generally
relevant to all games with doxastic componants – i.e. all games where
humans or analytical entities are involved.</p>

<h4 id="influencing-the-direction-of-attention-both-individually-or-collectively">① Influencing the direction of attention, both individually or collectively</h4>

<h4 id="influencing-amplifying-falsifying-or-fabricating-information-and-thereby-derivative-beliefs">② Influencing, amplifying, falsifying or fabricating information and, thereby, derivative beliefs</h4>

<h4 id="introspecting-the-nature-of-information-and-decision-treesforests-occluded-by-agent-compartmentalization">③ Introspecting the nature of information and decision trees/forests occluded by agent-compartmentalization</h4>

<p>Without perturbation and the “rationalizing irrationality”, you cannot
effectively engage in the third technique. Without introspecting into
the logistics, processes and decisions of your adversaries in the last
technique, you cannot effectively engage in former two
techniques. Further still, by restricting yourself to purely
deterministic or moreso predictable tactics, then you yourself become
more predictable. From the perspective of a human or analytical
entity, the assessment of another entities decision making or behavior
is exposed as a feeling. If you’re lucky, you’ll observe deterministic
behavior, but this is assuming you preemptively know the underlying
structures of your adversaries decision-trees beforehand – otherwise
your probing to reveal deterministic decision-making will be
<em>baseless</em>. Further, assuming that your adversary engages in at least
some irrational behavior, then such probing is less fruitful when it
assumes purely deterministic behavior patterns.</p>

<p>When the rationalist’s additively constructed beliefs render
themselves overly-deterministic, then they not only become more
predictable, but become less capable of predicting the behavior of
others. perturbation of noise is required to scan the space of your
adversaries decision trees and forests. There are discretized
conceptions of decision trees, but also continuous or analytical
conceptions. These are critical for enhancing the performance of
machine learning algoritms. BUT! To make inferences about networks
outside your control in adversarial signals analysis requires:
illogical behavior, non-deterministic behavior, irrational thought.</p>

<p>It is only by compelling your adversary to rationalize your
irrationally-motivated behavior that you can compel them to expose
their decision-making processes &amp; structures of incentivization. If
you only engage in simplistic deterministic behavior patterns, you
will be exposed – but also, you will not compel your adversary to
expose themselves.</p>

<p><a name="the-soul-your-problem-is-the-word"></a></p>

<h1 id="the-soul-your-problem-is-the-wordthe-soul-your-problem-is-the-word"><a href="#the-soul-your-problem-is-the-word">The Soul: Your Problem Is The Word</a></h1>

<p>If you don’t define the soul, you can’t say that what I define as the
soul doesn’t exist. You basically don’t like the word. And yes, if you
actually internalize the words written here and extrapolated from my
argument, it what I’m establishing as a baseline extends to
materialistic pan-psychism.</p>

<p><a name="the-baseline-and-its-extrapolation-to-panpsychism"></a></p>

<h3 id="the-baseline-and-its-extrapolation-to-panpsychismthe-baseline-and-its-extrapolation-to-panpsychism"><a href="#the-baseline-and-its-extrapolation-to-panpsychism">The Baseline and Its Extrapolation to Panpsychism</a></h3>

<p>What am I’m setting as the baseline? information representations are
encoded into the physical configuration of matter, but there is no
clear boundary between one physical container of information and
another. therefore, from one biological machine encoding state and
information to every other nearby biological machine, there is a very
grey line between one “container” of information and other life
forms. therefore: panpsychism. but the soul is in the information
ascribed to one individual (or lifeforms) identity as it is
distributed among other nearby (or faraway) lifeforms. however, the
information that defines an individual is not completely contained
within that biological entity. their true self are the disaggregated
shards reflected through society. therefore, my self extends (via our
interactions) into the reflections of my image that exist within you
and are completely out of my control.</p>

<p>Those who become aware of their soul, their true extent of self
outside their brain – and can exert control over it! – are far
better adapted to interacting within society than those who cannot,
whether you believe these ideas to be true or not! this is partially
what is so <em>dangerous</em> about the <em>ablation of causality</em>:
computationally, the problem of knowing these aspects of self
extending into society become increasingly recalcitrant. Even before
considering the introduction of non-physicalized artificial entities
– because social media and the internet disrupt our perception of
causality – then it becomes impossible to know the reverberations of
self throughout this material panpsychism. Therefore, it becomes
difficult to distinguish or know one’s identity as it is perceived by
others – or to know this materally dependent definition of
soul. Hence: the ablation of causality extends to an ablation of
knowledge of self.</p>

<p>Again, if you don’t understand the ideas behind what’s written in this
article, then you may not understand Carl Jung. I still have a lot to
learn about his ideas myself, but I at least have imagined the social
precipitation of psychological archetypes. His ideas are profound. I
cannot believe I had not understood psychology and sociology until
now.</p>

<p>The power of a proficient philosopher is that they do not simply make
their own reality – doing so is powerful, yes. However, the great
philosophers also make your reality, directly or indirectly, and they
do so regardless of whether you <em>believe</em> they do.</p>

<p>Oh … nevermind, we got a real “socialist” over here! They’re real
smart. They’ve studied economics and can employ rhetoric with
fallaciously <em>constructed</em> arguments whose ends were predetermined:
they want “free” things, without understanding that free of financial
cost doesn’t mean free of social cost.</p>

<h3 id="ontological-triumvirate-of-sociophysical-resourcesontological-triumvirate-of-sociophysical-resources"><a href="#ontological-triumvirate-of-sociophysical-resources">Ontological Triumvirate of Sociophysical Resources</a></h3>

<p>Social resources are intrinsically interconnected with financial
resources: one merely transduces from forms of one to forms of the
other. There is a third component to this ontology of sociophysical
resource-types: informational resources. The triumvirate: financial,
social and informational resources, where the first two are
overlapping subsets of the last. There is no financial cost without
social consequences. There are no financial or social actions without
informational consequences. Did you bother to think about this or did
you merely read a copy of Marx’s genius <em>19th century</em> genius <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Das_Kapital">Das
Capital</a> without
comprehending 20th century history? Nor do you understand economics
pragmatically … oh that’s great. Now you want to dictate to me to
act deterministically: so you can predict me; psychologicall abuse me;
plot to socially engineer me and everyone else like me? Go shove your
fucking Marxist dialectic up the materialistic ass that birthed it:
your own.</p>

<p>Socialism will lead to Communism in <em>America</em>, which <em>does not happen
without undermining strategic economic and geopolitical imperatives
for American domestic and foreign policy.</em> You lose, go read a fucking
book.</p>

<p>Oh boy! I got myself started on the Marxist-Leninists who think their
petty revolutions are anything other than power changing hands from
one social structure to another. The only difference is that their
power structures do not allow for the conservation of value/resource
in financial form, since saving rates plummet in proto/communist
societies. Therefore, people still exchange value in society, but they
end up <strong>bartering with social resources</strong> (i.e. corruption) instead
of being capable of conserving stores of value independent from the
exertion of power by corrupt officials.</p>

<p>COMMUNISM IS A LIE. EAT A DICK, LENINISTS.</p>

<p>Originally from <a href="https://www.facebook.com/dconner.pro/posts/10205458719904074">this facebook
post</a>.</p>

<p>Here’s some more ideas to be outlined … be free, ideas, be free!</p>

<p>(This is more for my benefit than any poor souls who might be forced
to read my handwriting… if that’s you, my heart goes on)</p>

<p>In an unrelated note, an old lady brought a Tweety Bird into a
McDonald’s (in a cage) but he got dumped in the honey BBQ
sauce… almost got fried, but they caught the bastards that did
it…. poor lil nuggets. Same show tomorrow, different set list.</p>

<p>Obi Wan Sequitor plead yolo contendere: if you still got jokes with
non sequitors, ain’t nobody gettin ‘em, but they can’t electroshock
you just for that =&gt; i.e. the only correct rhyme to reason is no
reason at all; wherefore ❤ thou, serendipity, did they come to take
you away too?</p>

<p>Explanation of the previous paragraph: It took me 30 years to learn to
decouple myself from a dependency on rigidly structured intentionality
to inform all my “correct” actions/words — to finally learn how to be
spontaneous with words by decoupling myself from an irrational
dependency on “rational” cognition more determined by unconscious
programming than any legitimate rational thought process — only to be
subjugated by a constant deluge of irrationally structured accusations
of mental illness by people who only ever knew me as a programmed,
unconscious manakin.</p>

<p>Fuck y’all, I finally learned to life, but <em>now</em> y’all want to stop
and frisk every statement I make, while being incapable of
distinguishing any true non sequitor from any social physic or yore
theorema egregium … “and what have views”</p>

<p>Solo contendere? This is fine…</p>
